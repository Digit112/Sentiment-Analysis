i went for brunch on sunday overall i was pleased there was a variety of food so boredom was not possible my favorite dish was the vegetable quinoa stuff and the pigs in a blanket the mimosas and bloody marys were scrumptious as well and finally our waitress was nice and attentive my main issue was the cost of brunch seemed a bit exorbitant none of the food was mind blowing so i suppose ultimately what i was paying for was the bottomless drinks 
very good food here casual dining in the don caesar hotel for starters try the goat cheese fritters and the calamari both are outstanding we had the fish and chips and the fish tacos made with mahi-mahi service was outstanding and our waiter kept our drinks full i had to ding it a bit because my tacos were a little cold but not so bad to send them back it was a very enjoyable dining experience all around 
i've been here twice and was generally pleased on both visits the guys that work there are very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about music while being very friendly the selection is great for classic rock and the like they also have a back room with tons of jazz and classical the prices are right in the pocket of not being too cheap but not expensive at all the first time i went in they were having a 15 off sale which was cool you can tell they only sell records that are in decent to great condition because everything i bought was more or less in great shape the 2 dollar bin has yielded a couple of great finds that were in excellent condition as well i sold some records here too they picked through to see what they wanted and offered less than i expected it to be but offered a larger price in store credit i bought the allotment of my store credit and went over that amount and they still called it even so that was a nice gesture like others said it's on the small side you have to move out of the way for people sometimes and move a box here and there to look whats under it but i'd rather have a store that has too many records than too little i will absolutely keep checking back at this place for their fair prices and very good selection with guys who really know the music they are selling 
the bar 33 is nice but restaurant overrated had grilled redfish twice still raw on inside gross
the place is located inside the new china town square there is no sign outside and the address on yelp doesn't either so it was frustrating finding this restaurant second soggy tacos couldn't even hold up the last one to take a bite without it breaking tried the bulgogi al pastor and carnitas bulgogi is the most popular one but tasted the worst out of those 3 i'm an indian girl with korean tastebuds so trust me when i say don't get the bulgogi i wouldn't come here again also they have a 9 minimum for cc oh and the yelp 10 off when you check in doesn't work anymore lame take it down then sorry i get mean when my food doesn't hit the spot 
ordered chicken fried rice rice was not fried not sure if that's the normal way there definitely not what i expected
i see from some of the other reviews that people have had both good and bad experiences with drain medics all i can tell you is that this was the 3rd time i've called them for slow drains and each time i've been completely satisfied with every aspect of the work previously i had a slow bathroom drain and two years ago a slow kitchen drain it was the kitchen again this time after attempting to fix the problem myself first with hot water and dawn detergent then using a hand snaking tool at 7 15 am this morning i called and left a message with drain medics within a half hour someone called back and i was able to make an appointment for 10 am today at 8 30 ken called and said he and tony would be at my house in about 25 minutes they were ken was the lead person tony was his trainee after checking out the slow draining kitchen sink they went down to my basement and the drain pipe below it had an access point they used to feed in 40 feet of cable the cause of the slow drain was sludge and required two runs with the cable after that the sink drained properly the two men cleaned up after the job and i was charged the flat fee of 75 as advertised i am still satisfied with drain medics and will continue to call them in the future as needed 
the desserts and dinner are spectacular not too expensive very fairly priced for the high quality and amount of food i had the schnitzel and it was fantastic came out piping hot flavorful my partner had a ground steak that was so incredibly flavorful the dessert omg come here for a great dinner coffee dessert friendly outdoor sitting facing state street great service by steven 
i placed an order last night and went it to pick it up around 7 only two guys were working and it was really busy i was in my way to the hospital bringing dinner and was slightly frantic and late when i arrived the guy behind the counter said they tried to call and my chicken would not be ready for another 45 minutes well i got a little upset i apologized and told him i was in the way to the hospital where a friend has been admitted and he went back to the kitchen talked to the guy in the back and in 10 minutes i had chicken kabobs and the rest of my order and a chocolate cake food was perfect and i felt like i was treated like a friend not just a customer thank you zoes kitchen for understanding and taking care of me
i love this place so much chris is our favorite bartender i honestly do not know how he does it during brunch he is usually the only one working and the place is packed even when it's packed chris still manages to keep up he's like superman another thing that was really cool about him was that he used his own tip money to give my son some change to play the video games there my son was soooo excited about that if he's happy then i can drink my mimosas happily - lol we love the frachos my friend from vegas stops here just for the frachos when she is in town the wings are awesome tooo but if you want kickass service and the best deal on mimosas for brunch - noble pie chris are where it's at 
we were seated immediately the food is good and flavorful service was pleasant and quick drinks were ok yet weak 
love this place amazing food great prices wonderful staff vegetarian-friendly too 
i returned some time ago sorry for late review and did enjoy my food but the spicy sesame-seared ahi tuna was unexpectedly served cold on top of warm rice so it was only cold on some parts making me unsure if it was intentional i had to stick to the cauliflower rice and wait a while and for the server to return to verify it was meant to be cold she did offer to heat it up cold while unexpected was fine with me i just needed it confirmed it would not make me sick as i'm not familiar with cooking fish and am fairly new to eating it a manager later came by to confirm it was meant to be cold and offered to get me something else instead which i declined i appreciated the service regarding this but i urge them to mention this on the menu i don't recall how long we waited for our meals this time i noticed the prices are high and the amount of fish was small but the quality of the dishes still make me want to come back to try other things fyi the ahi tuna was only mildly spicy if you're like me and can handle some spiciness you'll be fine 
wish i could review the food but since the restaurant was less than half empty we stood there for 5 minutes waiting to be seated and were never even acknowledged i can't we went over to the cigar city brewing and had a delicious lunch 
joe is the best barber in town i flew back home but i usually see him twice a month dude is incredible he is so laid back great to talk to while getting a cut easy going professional and most importantly a wizard on the blade i would recommend you seeing him overall these dudes are amazing great service 
i had them do tint and clear bra tint was decent however clear bra was not very good customer service is a train wreck go somewhere better 
ok so not much atmosphere here but the food more than makes up for it we ordered neapolitan pizza with mushrooms olives spinach pepperoni cooked perfectly dough was fresh and sauce very tasty only complaints are the beer was not cold and there was no background music so it was pretty quiet i think this is more a take out place but with a couple of tweaks it would be fine to eat inside i definitely would like to try some of the italian dishes so i'm sure we'll be back reasonably priced give it a try 
i too am from california and also know my poke after work at one of the local hospitals i saw a new poke restaurant poke brothers after looking at the menu figured i would give it a try the staff was friendly and very welcoming all of the ingredients looked incredibly fresh and the restaurant was quite clean the food was fantastic really all so delicious and i can't wait to return avocado fresh both the tuna and salmon appeared to be a high-quality so tasty kudos to poke brothers 
we went here for brunch today while we were on vacation and had a pretty decent experience our food was delicious and the mimosas were great our service however was nothing exciting at all our server never told us her name and never came back to check on us until time to get the check if it weren't for a sweet trainee bringing us refills paying for bottomless mimosas with our server would have been a total waste of money the food was wonderful i had a jerk chicken burrito with garlic fries and loved every single bite 
stopped in here for dinner after catching a movie at the nearby amc walked right in and got seated on a saturday around 5pm we started with the bottomless chips and salsa the chips were way too salty for my liking i went with the mango-chile chicken off of their guiltless menu menu said it came with mexican rice and steamed broccoli but mine came with black beans instead of the broccoli it was a small piece of chicken and luke warm at best taste wise it wasn't bad and had a little kick to it but i felt like it should have been hotter the burgers that the rest of my family had was fine service was very good throughout the meal they had the kiosk machines at the tables which presumably would let your order pay your check and play games at the table but ours wasn't working 
service was trash if it wasn't for me trying to attempt to seat myself i probably wouldn't of been noticed and still standing in line but it doesn't end there it took around 10 mins for a server to come back and ask if i wanted a water or drink i wasn't checked on during my meal but hey this review can't be all bad it has to be a reason why they got one star rite yes the food was great atleast the cook knows how to do their job 
love the food it is delicious very clean and spacious great atmosphere the only problem i had was with the manager kate she had a horrible attitude extremely cocky no customer service or respect she needs to go elsewhere 
excellent mexican with large portions enjoyed the salsa bar though we'd have liked a mild option but all in all a fantastic experience did i mention they even have beer on tap 
we wanted to try something local so we tried shells this is a great casual local place with a very comfortable feel when you come as for rosie she is awesome she made great recommendations gave great descriptions of the food and was quite entertaining with her stories they are famous for their pasta dishes and they don't disappoint my wife and son had the seafood pasta and the baby lobster pasta respectively and they couldn't finish due to the large portion i had the lobster combo which was a half of a lobster cut down the middle stuffed with crab and it came with a shrimp skewer it was really good the prices are good and for checking in on yelp i got a free margarita so come check out shells you will like it 
we went for appetizers after a late day the location and decor are nice and the staff were very pleasant service was good however the food itself at least for the appetizers we had were just so so stuffed grape leaves were tough - all on the platter i have run across this for one or two in the past but not all ate the rice but had to leave the leaf itself the little pitas were mostly dry dough with almost no filling the hummus was ok but very small serving for the price this was the first experience here and all in all not high on my list of lebanese eateries 
this store is close to home easy access off of watson road organized the same way as any other walgreens and is usually pretty quick in and out type of place i've come here for a variety of reasons from picking up some cold medicine prescriptions random household needs and little travel necessities i've forgotten while at target the store is less than a mile from my house and it's super convenient also it's in the same plaza as a grocery store a massage place optical office and restaurants what more could you ask service has always been friendly whether i am at the normal checkout area or the pharmacy i've never had any issue finding anything i need as long as it's something walgreens carry they have it 
loved the location of this place it's super close to hotels and right in town the inside decor of the place is pretty cool despite having no cheese when we came in the workers provided us with free garlic knots while we waited 
they don't answer their phone either poor service or closed not going to make it on clearwater beach not answering their phone 10 try's just rode the bike by their location they are closed at least for the evening not a smart move on labor day weekend some mom and pop places will do this because their family is on vacation but usually they will post a sign outside their place of business not every business updates their yelp account not a review of their food just their availability and service
my favorite pizza in the boise area they have a great hand tossed pie with all the favorites they have a habanero pizza that has a moderate to extream heat versions their house triple pie belgian beer on tap that is very good check it out 
this is one of my favorite restaurants in brandon really great food my favorites are the crab legs and the shrimp and scallops pasta highly recommend customer service is always great on my last visit i was served by alajandro and he was really nice was always making sure we were enjoying our meal and that we didn't need anything 5 stars all the way
not bad but considering that there are an infinite of phenomenal restaurants on central this one just wasn't as up to par menu options were pretty eccentric and good but there were elements of each dish that just made this 4 stars rather than 5 vegetables too salty potatoes too charred tuna too grisly etc still a great choice 4 a quick bite but by no means something i would return to was more of a one and done
its upsetting to not give this better stars because the service is good and the ambience is lovely but the food just isn't good this was my fourth visit so clearly i've given them many tries the food is so heavy and way over seasoned and over done they do have a nice wine list though and really lovely people working there easy valet parking and dog friendly they need to update their menu though - they rave about their brussels sprouts and honestly - they aren't good and we always order them 
good atmosphere yummy food it's kinda like a little joe's crab shack we had lobster crab shrimp all were excellent seasons were solid typical seafood prices look to spend 30 a person if you want crab or lobster deff worth a try if you like to get some good crab and shrimp they prepare it in a big steamer sack so it's very messy don't wear nice clothes probably a fun relaxed date spot as well 
this is one of those places that you want to be successful with an owner who appears to put her heart into the business driving by around midnight the night before i visited i saw someone still inside working when i went to lunch today i found out it was the owner she had spent the night there working the menu is limited so you expect awesomeness with the items they do have i ordered the italian roast beef that comes with chips potato chips dumped out of a large bag i tried to upgrade to a cup of soup for my side but no soup today maybe later this week i was told the good the sandwich tasted great a good balance of roast beef cheese and peppers on a roll nicely toasted while waiting i also saw them make omelettes with real eggs and fresh items the bad out of the bag potato chips as a side for a place that has a very limited menu with made from scratch prominently advertised i expected to have homemade chips when i read chips come as the side homemade pasta salad or potato salad as a side with have been so much more appropriate for their made from scratch sandwiches the ugly not sure if the owner was overly tired from being at the store through the night but as i sat there i witnessed a lot of cross contamination going on as she prepared items the owner wiped her nose with her hand then reached into a clear plastic container of strawberries to put into someone's drink the owner threw raw bacon into a skillet then proceeded to grab different ingredients that were not going to be cooked she even went and used the cash register after handling raw uncooked items while preparing someone's food she popped some of the food in her mouth fortunately the employee who was there used gloves and put together my sandwich the employee even removed her gloves to use the cash register the owner needs to start using disposable gloves as she prepares customer's food there were only a few tables occupied at noon as good as my sandwich tasted it made me wonder if some of the deficiencies i observed were an ongoing issue that impacts return visits from customers 
before you read all these sub par reviews know this if you don't like this pizza its because youve been eating american pizza ala little ceasars all your life when you come here realize this will be a new culinary experience for you this is real artisan pizza - and is very serious business this guy explains it best http www chow com food-news 54458 obsessives-pizza really bummed me out to read these lame reviews nashville will never progress as a culinary center in the south will all these knuckleheads running the reviews this is the best pizza i've ever had 
the reuben here is a friendly staff local beers live music on the weekends my husband and i love this place for real - the reuben please eat it 
great cheesesteaks delivery is always almost unbelievably fast and arrives hot i ordered a chicken finger platter with 2 sides it was at my door 12 minutes after i ordered not always this fast but i'd say 2 out of 3 times for sure with the 3rd time still being very reasonable 20-30mins cheese fries mozz sticks onion rings it's all delicious one of the best in ridley by far 
my recent experience at vsec was very positive the staff and doctors are friendly professional and caring our cat was seen right away and luckily recovered well staff was able to process pet insurance paperwork efficiently and cheerfully so happy to have this 24 hour resource in the neighborhood i sleep better knowing they are there when one's vet can't be 
always amazing and consistent i will drop off anytime when traveling between la and san francisco just for this authentic and delicious experience 
this was one of the saddest trips i've made to a restaurant in recent memory my wife and i were there around 530 on friday 8 10 18 the service was completely pathetic first we ordered drinks and after 25 mins our drinks finally arrived with an excuse from the server that the bar was backed up i really did not need to hear the excuse but that should have been my first clue that the rest of this dining experience was not going to be get any better servers who make excuses for other co workers are in my opinion are completely clueless to what is actually going on unfortunetley this was not the last excuse we received from this inept server next we ordered our food 2 appetizers and some grilled chicken tenders from the kids menu the chicken was just a plan grilled chicken breast sliced up the major problem was that the chicken was loaded up with a black pepper that when my 5 yr old daughter took a bite it put her in tears because the spice on it was overbearing even for an adult is was to spicy the appetizers we ordered were the poutine fries and mussels these appetizers were somewhat decent but really not worth the price they were offered at at this point we decided to cut our stay short and not order anymore food the sad part is that the kids order comes with a sundae which we decided not to stay for because we have already been sitting for 90 mins and had no clue how much longer the sundae would take my daughter was very unhappy about this we could not justify having to sit in this place for who knows how much longer the last problem we had was getting our bill this in itself was a chore as our server had dealt with the 5 other tables around us and kept skipping over us to bring the bill we had to flag down another server for them to bring us our bill all in all i would not recommend this place for any family to go to i really feel these servers could all use a little training in customer service and when they are actually suppose to be working they should learn to put there smart devices away so there job is there sole focus 
the blue cheese burger was good and my wife had the chicken and she was satisfied i found that the items on the menu were way over priced i liked the vibe of the restaurant and the decor but either you want to be a fine dine restaurant or casual up scale i like the infusion and ingredients but the plastic one ounce cups have to go the restaurant has already changed owners so i hope you great success 
great place for a stiff drink although they lack in quality and size t v's c'mon joes keep up with the times i get a headache every time i go there i guess it could be the drinks 
the food was pretty tasty sadly the vibe here wasn't the best for lunch maybe a night time place next time 
one of the best speakeasies i've ever been to i always try to seek out secret bars and craft cocktails when traveling and this hit those marks and more the bartenders actually more rightfully mixologists were super friendly and helpful in picking drinks specific to my taste it was a beautiful bar and pleasant to hang out at as well my friend and i easily got seated which is potentially an anomaly but it would've been worth a wait loved the vibe the drinks and the prices were fair don't skip this one 
at blaze and after waiting in line 25 minutes they refused to cut me up some tomatoes its lunch hour how does a pizza place run out of tomato's during lunch time well actually there are tomatoes in the back but because so many people called in direct staff quote i can't get any tomatoes on my pizza manager wouldn't get my tomatoes either some days your a 5 today your a 2 and a 2 only because the guy at the end taking the pizza out the ovenwas super 
classy cat consignment customer service is superb we have utilized their services three times in the last 4 years both selling our furniture or buying furniture i have recommended their services to all my friends with confidence high quality furniture accessories at a great prices meh
this is the first time i've tried a vietnamese restaurant and it wasn't an awful experience the pho was tasty to me even though it looks like from other reviews it's not the best i also got spring rolls that were good not the best i've had but they were still pretty good maybe because i have nothing to compare it to but i thought the food all around was pretty good the staff was friendly and attentive i think i will have to try another vietnamese spot and then come back but i would still come back here again either way 
amazing restaurant the waiter was kind the food great and the service very good definitely i will come back - 
i've been through cherokee countess times and never really noticed this place but this past saturday i stopped in holy weirdness first of all they were playing eerie halloweenish music then looking around it all soaks in this place is for freaks not saying i'm not one of them magazines on pornographic dismemberment baby dolls in jars creepy pictures and books and music fit for every fetish i like this place but it's not for everyone 
this is shop full of little collectable and decor the only cool part i saw was the old metal hangers they reused from other old buildings 
loved it wonderful service delicious food and fun atmosphere our waiter suggested the southern baked style oysters and they were fantastic definitely stop here if you get the chance 
i had a great experience at stanley's i went in needing some advice about weatherproofing some wood and john was super friendly and helpful and the woman at the cash register was also friendly and helpful when one of the prices on my items was miss-marked it was in the wrong bin she have me the lower price great customer service 
once you're a jet you're a jet all the way i love jet's till my last dyin' day their new york style is unbelievably delicious i'm not sure why they push their deep dish because the new york style blows every other pizza place in st louis out of the park another thing i've never experienced at a pizza place is the outstanding customer service i get every time i come here i don't expect much customer service when it comes to ordering pizza but the people at jet's have set a new precedent for customer service at a pizza store they always make a super fine pizza and are very friendly they even remembered my order when i call in i've recommended this place to allot of my friends and they too are impressed with jet's this pizza place will jet you off to a new higher plain of pizza experiences 
it sounds as if the breakfast is awesome here unfortunately we have only had lunch and dinner here the dinner was okay not fantastic for the price for a restaurant of this caliber i was so disappointed in the frozen veggies served with my steak dinner i would have expected fresh tasty veggies so it's been over a year and my 3 sisters and i decided to go for lunch if i'm going to order a 15 dollar burger not only do i expect better favors but more than 12 fries we all agreed the atmosphere is beautiful but the food although the menu sounds good and interesting is not executed well the flavors werent balanced not to mention my sister and i shared our hamburger and both got sick i still might give breakfast a try but i'll never eat here for lunch or dinner again for the there are better spots 
i'm on the fence here i dined here during the week once it was fantastic i went again on a saturday morning and it left much to be desired on both occasions i had the audrey special scrambled eggs bacon home fries on the week day the food was fresh hot plentiful the weekend visit the eggs tasted powdery the bacon tasted old the home fries uneventful and the portion less generous as a side note i actually went back because i enjoyed the home fries so much so you can imagine my disappointment i'll visit again for sure the place is very agreeable and the staff is friendly hopefully my saturday morning visit was just an anomaly so if you're debating on stopping by i'd encourage you to go and see for yourself just manage your expectations 
always my favorite place for special occasions usually this means my birthday i no longer live in nashville but when i'm here visiting family i am a royal pain until i convince everyone to go 
super friendly staff the waitress gave us a bunch of local recommendations of things to do the breakfast omelet was good and reasonable 
great service money pouch was amazing portion size for everything is worth the price 
what an incredible experience food drinks and atmosphere were absolutely amazing we tried so many things on the menu its tough to say what was best some of which were also seasonal specials but this place has it all if you are into asian fusion definitely on the pricey side but you get what you pay for an excellent spot to frequent for special occasions with family friends significant others 
ah freebirds nothing really compares to this ultimate burrito joint and while it may well have been my addiction to large portions and guacamole when i was ucsb i never leave california without stopping here at least once read the reviews for yourself but the food is always good and the guac is truly amazing of course there are long lines - it's cheap and it tastes good every freshman on campus eats here at least twice a week a must if you're ever in the area 
my first time herw very interesting sort of like ordering a quiznos sub but with pizza good quality and selection of sauces and toppings good value for the pizza fast for lunch but very smokey from the lack of ventilation they have signs up apologizing for the smoke and announcing new ventilation soon i enjoyed the taste but not the egg i got as one of my four toppings polite staff they need a hand sanitizer or washstand in the restaurant to wash your hands before and after the pizza is thin crust and a little messy so i had sauce on my fingers until i was able to get back to work 
my gps stopped working and was hot snd frustrated when i found this restaurant and then they put me by the hot window when i asked to move they were very accommodating i was pleased to see they had lemon chicken as one of their lunch specials so of course i ordered it you get soup and an appetizer i'm not a big fan of chinese soups but their won ton soup was delicious
omg kayla was sooooooo awesome and brought my brows back to life and she took the time to introduce me to a product that i just had to have thank you waxing the city i'm not from nola but i'll definitely be on the lookout for other locations 
i was just introduced to this longstanding local establishment last night i hail from northeast philly known for it's neighborhoods and this bar screamed neighborhood bar even though it's located in a half country-half suburb location in south joisey i was brought here for one thing and one thing only it's wings walking in and seeing a sign that reads best wings in the world i felt like buddy the elf whoda thunk it but the best wings in the world happen to be located in berlin nj ok so it was a bit of hyperbole on their part but at least i wasn't completely let down it was all-you-can-get wing night for under 10 they serve them to you 12 at a time and i put away two servings by my calculations i'm nice at math that's under 50 cents a wing can't beat that well i guess technically you could but i know a good deal when i see one the wings were a goldilocks' approved size-- not too big and not too small for wings to be good it's all about the sauce- taste and the amount they were appropriately tossed in a very tasty slightly spicy sauce in my opinion there could have been more sauce as i like looking down and seeing a pond of sauce when i'm all finished my only criticism is that there weren't the usual options for spicyness--just one kind i tend to lean towards spicier the better yes i'm one of those people who subscribes to the emerilian way of life-- always looking to kick it up a notch the great thing about this place is it actually sells the wing sauce in a jar great way to take the taste home with you as far as the rest of the bar it's a huge bar with plenty of tables and there's also a live band that plays my only gripe with the band was that they did not honor my request to play any wham songs no matter how many times i requested they also have great food specials and a pool table that happened to be hosting league night for the local pool sharks 
this panera is better than others we have been to in the area the staff is so much more friendly and helpful overall panera seems to forget that we want to eat in clean restaurants so we usually get it to go and do not bother with the dining room because it always feels messy
one of my three favourite bbq places in stl i usually get the pulled pork sandwich with applesauce and sweet potato fries the sauce selection is great i would certainly recommend calling in and placing a carry out order when it's busy 
i don't know what took me so long to try this place out seriously the best pizza i've had in a long time also took home a loaf of bread which was fantastic this will definitely be in my rotation for pizza 
i figured out why this place has 3 1 2 starts check out the not recommended reviews they are all one star not sure why they are keeping up reviews from 4 years ago instead of the more recent just be aware everyone who is looking to yelp for advice on whether to eat here or not 
clean friendly and convenient santa barbara has always rolled up its streets at night having a 7 eleven on upper state street is a huge plus discovering this one was almost as good as discovering in about 1959 that a loops restaurant had been built among the orange groves at about the same location ding one star because the columbian coffee was cold regular coffee was nice and hot 
great overall experience food was prepared extremely well we had pork belly tots as an app and they were excellent my wife had the plumb pork also very good i had blackened mahi that was cooked to a perfect temp however a bit too much cayenne in the spice mix even for me had to pass on what sounded like an excellent dessert menu give it a try you will not be disappointed 
booked a room through expedia for my wife she arrived to find the hotel was changing carpets and decided to check into another hotel nearby i called them and they were extremely rude and hung up on me saying to take the matter up with expedia my credit card was charged the full amount of the stay even though she never checked in i am in the process of disputing the charge with my credit card company 
i never thought that i would be writing a positive review for here but i am i ordered two dozen cupcakes from here for my baby shower they turned out amazing they were a hit also they were nice enough to let me use all 30 worth of gift certificates i had bought at the double dollar deals website even though the gift certificates said they couldn't be used together for my shower we ordered 6 red velvet 6 strawberry shortcake 6 batch white cupcake pink frosting and 6 chocolate cherry type cupcakes they all turned out great we had to save them a day in our house fyi i was told never to put them in the fridge for a day since my shower was on a sunday and batch is closed on sunday but considering they held up pretty well i had to order an additional 4 cupcakes for myself my husband and friends for saturday night to keep everyone out of the shower cupcakes so we ordered a mocha one red velvet one pumpkin one and an apple one all of which were amazing yum there are two reasons i'm not giving them 5 stars first i found a pit in one of the cherries in their cupcakes but hey i guess this could be a good thing too because it means their cupcakes are fresh second they don't give a discount for bulk orders i spent about 70 on 28 cupcakes it would be nice if they offered something like buy 11 get one free even or 10 off for orders of more than x amount but they dont 
excellent restaurant with many entree options the servers are great the appetizers are unique and delicious the entrees are prepared to perfection this is a place that's not very expensive but has a high end quality i'll be back 
ok so i had this in the airport at 7 in the morning so i'm sure it's not the same the bread was good so was the cheese wiz but the meat was kinda scarce i will have to try this at the actual store to be fair 
could not wait to try this winery as the photos were amazing went with a few girlfriends and the atmosphere did not disappoint it was as wonderful as i thought it would be the wine is just ok i like many different tastes but nothing was 5 star we wanted to sit and enjoy so i ordered the meat and cheese platter very disappointed for the money it was not worth it a few pieces of cheese and meat definitely not worth it it's a shame because such an amazing place i would love to sit and drink and enjoy most likely will not return 
i've been to several nail salons in the area and this one is by far the best they're clean great service and friendly staff out of all the places i've been they're the best with gel manicure last around 3 weeks and they fix every tiny little mistake if they make one would recommend to anyone 
the charleston she crab bisque was amazing had a work event here and the staff was super friendly and made the event fun loved how they gave the history of the building and the property overall just a great experience 
beautiful place friendly service great food what more can you ask for we stopped for breakfast and everything was amazing from the omelett to the potato's to the fresh baked bread adapted to allergies without a fuss 
so delicious all the benedicts most of them are southwestern style looked delicious and i was thrilled with the falcon and the complementary for first-timers snickerdoodle pancake was the perfect dessert 
omg i had such bad anxiety no one knew where the parking was directed me to 3 terminals took me over an hour to find my car maybe was my fault besides that was def toooo pricey due to the stipulations 
i come here when i want consistant attentive and excellent service the portions are outrageous so either bring your appetite or someone to share with oh and be sure to save room for dessert i've never had a bad one here 
its our regular grocery store just a block away from where we live most of the time the shop is not that crowded though you might want to avoid sunday evenings the people are real friendly if you check out their weekly offers and go they have amazing savings its far better in prices compared to fresh grocer bt they dont have that much variety in some sections like chocolates they have a decent international section too they have this one lady who tends to be slow at the counter but the rest of the staff are friendly and efficient veggies like peppers and carrots are better bought from the produce truck but most of the veggies from the produce truck tend to get spoilt fast check out the veggie section and buy stuff that are cheaper than 1 from supreme since thats the price at the truck they have deals every weeek so check them out 
great spot for breakfast if you can sit outside away from the bar atmosphere extremely inexpensive for a ton of food and great service 
the waitress jessica couldn't remember who ordered what for the life of her there were only three of us and she didn't even try she tossed the dishes on the table the baked flounder was dry and didn't taste fresh there was nothing offered for the crab cake like tartar sauce the beer menu is deplorable we were there saturday july 23rd around 6 00 pm we were seated around 6 30 
the best italian food in south philly and that's saying a lot it doesn't get any better than villa di roma 
i just want to start out by saying this is hands down my lifetime dentist for as long as live in the tampa area about 4 years ago i had a crown done on my front tooth by my prior dentist in new hampshire this past sunday the crown broke entirely off leaving me looking like a jackolantern just in time for halloween lol i obviously had a mini meltdown so i immediately called my dentist in brandon of whom i will not name pressed the option for dental emergency and left a voicemail advising i'd be needing an emergency appointment as soon as possible expecting a call back on monday i didnt hear back on sunday so in the meantime i went online looking at reviews for other dentist just incase to make sure i'd be making the right choice in using my primary dentist ive been a patient of i found many great reviews on dr wyatt by monday morning i had decided to call south tampa dentistry instead and see if i could get in with dr wyatt for an emergency appointment as a brand new patient his receptionist nikki immediately treated me with the upmost respect and understanding for my situation and made sure that i would get squeezed in immediately within 2 hours of my initial call i was sitting in the dentist chair talking directly with dr wyatt himself he was so kind and educational and most importantly he was honest he made me feel like he's here to help not make a buck off me he went over my options thoroughly and did what was best for me as the patient not only on the dental aspect but also financially i went into his office dreading the pricetag and walked out feeling relieved impressed educated and cared for dr wyatt and his staff were all amazing and i cannot even begin to thank them enough for taking care of me so swiftly and getting me back to looking myself again never once was i asked to write a review and now i understand why the patients online have been so compelled to share their expereinces this was truly the best customer service experience of my life ----oh and as for my dentist in brandon yeah still hasnt called me back from my emergency call on sunday- i've got a review for them too 
love this place i order at least twice a week great food great taste i love getting combo a all my favorites in one for a great price 
the food at sammy's is never disappointing it's a perfect new orleans down home place the po boys are big and messy and the plate lunches could satisfy anyone i also love their salads big and beautiful full of different types of lettuce tomatoes and onions each day there's about a dozen daily specials along with their standard sandwich menu another thing the sides to choose from are wonderful i love the creamed spinach 
the decor is dated but the food is always great and service fabulous the place is also a cool piece of history and they also have great jazz to be heard on weekends 
this was our first time at flamingo a-go-go and we'd definitely be back the service was amazing and the food was delicious danielle our waitress was so nice and personable she always made sure our drinks were full and make killer recommendations highly recommend the chicken fried chicken 
the most uncomfortable massage of my fuckin life the guy was waaaay too handsy and was trying to spend the majority of the time rubbing my butt when my problem areas were else where i had to pull my towel up several times and tell him that was enough then started rubbing my upper thighs yes right by my vagina i left so fuckin mad and violated
sometimes even the most basic chain restaurant can really shine not because of the food but because of the people i always seem to have a good experience at this subway due to the staff almost every time i stop by i am always greeted by bonnie who is always friendly and greets every customer with a smile and a great friendly attitude it's enough to help turn around even those having the worst of days in fact i will actually go out of my way and stop at this location over the mall simply because of the customer service and friendly attitude here by not only bonnie but the entire of the staff as far as food goes this is your typical subway stop on in and let bonnie and her friendly co-workers help make lunch or dinner exactly your way 
i love bookstores so i can't bring myself to rate this lower that 3-stars but to be honest i couldn't walk through and could barely walk in if you swing by the bookstore on dauphine you'll get a good sense for a bookstore that's tough to navigate because it's so tight but arcadian you literally has no way to move through the store it seemed more like storage unit than a store if you're a smaller human being you might be able to find some gems -- and i hope you do -- but if you're a regular size human being or larger you're gonna have a rough time 
best enchilada of my life fish and shrimp with creamy chipotle sauce 
guys this place is pretty rad i live nearby so i called to place a takeout order the guy on the phone was super nice and my food came as i ordered it i'm about to sound like most of the other reviews for this place but that's a good thing consistency i got the combo chicken gyro plate and it was fabulous super moist and flavorful meat not spicy hold the rice bc i said so buttery smooth hummus and a yummy side salad a pita too the lamb was generously topped with tzatziki and the chicken had lots of garlic sauce it wasn't runny enough to call it sauce more of a whipped yogurt consistency that i could eat on everything even better i can easily stretch it to two meals getting my 13 worth the only rub was that they didn't want to sub fries for rice even though they're the same price on the sides menu they subbed extra hummus or salad instead waaahh somebody call the wambulance jk i'll live and i'll most def be back 
husband i shared 6 different macaroons to-go favorite was the s'mores they were a little big though i prefer a two bite macaroon shop was cute i'd like to come back try some other treats 
ordered a pizza from this place taste was ok it arrived room temp uncut i suppose you have to ask for pizza to be cut had it delivered to our hotel room good thing we had a microwave and utinsils to cut it the this crust was soggy and easy to cut with a regular butter knife part of the crust was blackened charred unlike most folks i'm a crust lover we were starved so well it is what it is with a price tag of 28 delivered one would expect to be a bit more
i love breakfast stop they have all the usual breakfast items what tickles my fancy though is that they have waffles and their coffee is good enough to drink black the waffles are always perfectly light and crispy my boyfriend usually orders off the daily specials board and is always happy with what he gets we just had to order takeout while the dining room is closed and everything was packed perfectly no gravy ended up where it didn't belong 
great fast service every employee was kind and polite the owner david was very nice and treated his employees like family will be back soon to keep trying the variety of such many great mouth watering creations thank you daves dogs
i have been a member of navy federal for a few years now i absolutely appreciate the respectful and helpful customer service over the phone and how simple their website and mobile application is but i was extremely upset with this branch and the most recent experience i had i applied for a consolidation load and drove about an hour through terrible winter weather on the pa turnpike to pick up the consolidation loan and sign a bank note i had brought my government approved identification because i had misplaced my state issued drivers license the day prior i waited nearly an hour to speak with the branch manager i introduced myself and without hesitation she said you need a drivers license she was very rude to me and wasn't concerned with my situation or even cared to remotely explain any further details to possibly resolve the situation i was shocked at how i was treated as a customer i will not be doing business loan wise with navy federal i called to cancel the loan and will not be returning to that branch for future business customer appreciation care and concern is what i look for most when doing business at this particular branch i was completely unsatisfied 
i found this place by accident and at first thought it was just a playground but it's so much more there's actually a trail and other things like volleyball nets and i'm just in love with this spot the wooden castle is adorable for the kids i haven't really seen something like that until here great use of space and it's dog friendly 
the food here is decent but the staff's lack of care and attention is absolutely lackluster 
have been there many times and never have had a bad experience the wait staff is usually the best of of my favorite waitress's always tells us she is happy when she sees the place are finished food is consistent not the biggest portions but just enough margaritas are a bit watered down but the beers are cold and priced right a place that you can take a family friends or a date i know a lot of people are a bit worried about norristown but parking is right outside the restaurant take a chance and you will not be disappointed 
this is a nice cute store i really like their ice cream also have gotten shakes a few times the best one so far has been coconut explosion with chocolate syrup so yummy we live walking distance from here so is usually our to go place when we want a quick ice cream or shake whoever is behind the counter has always been attentive and friendly 
we wish there were more ikea stores in the tampa bay area it's a fantastic place we've purchased many storage items and are pleased with the quality and durability easy assembly wood is not particle board but natural pine and finishes are perfect i love the smell of wood every time i open the liquor cabinet and it's solid even after frequent use do you need storage items they've got them rugs check glassware yup the store is massive we had small loveseat for a very long time mattresses are good we've had two memory foam great for guest rooms the store is so well planned and clean never ate there but it's usually too crowded which is a positive sign it's always a whole afternoon spent at this store they have everything you need to set up a house 
don't do it make yourself a grilled cheese at home it's more sanitary first the decor inside looks like ronald mcdonald threw up awful chairs and tables decorations etc i'm pretty sure they got all of the furniture and decorations at ikea my boyfriend and i both ordered the half bmt minus the tomato and the smoked corn chowder the girl taking the order was probably between 14-16 and was pleasant enough after we ordered the half sandwich and soup they decided to notice that the warmer for the smoked chicken corn chowder was empty i watched them fill it from a tupperware type container makes me wonder if the soup is just from a can and stir it around a little we ordered the bmt sandwich which was bacon cheddar cheese tomato and a mayo we got it without the mayo and tomato one person ordered after us and they got their food before we did probably because they were waiting on the soup but none of the employees told us what the wait was for and we stood there for about 20 minutes they made our sandwich and it sat there for about 15 minutes they made up our soup and the girl making our food also 14-16 realized it was still cold so she microwaved it by the time we got our food the sandwich was cold and the soup was luke-warm the soup had no flavor it was extremely bland and tasted like it came from a can definitely not made in house the reason i tell you not to eat here is while i was standing there waiting forever for my food i watched the guy making sandwiches make up a plate in plastic gloves then go wipe down the cooking station with a clearly dirty towel then go back to the food counter and pick up someone's sandwich without changing his gloves he didn't make my food so i felt comfortable eating mine but i really wanted to tell the lady not to eat her sandwich i think the main problem with this place is they employee teenagers who obviously don't care about their job they are extremely slow and obviously have no sanitary skills and have little to no customer service skills i would hate to see how long it would take to get a meal if it was busy just do yourself a favor and make yourself a grilled cheese anything they offer there you can make at home and won't have to pay 9 for it 
i have worked with mr olson in the past regarding selling my dental practice as well as getting professional advice on other legal matters he is very professional and knowledgable and i highly recommend him as a trustworthy dental attorney with a great deal of integrity and common sense 
ordered through door dash got a confirmation right away over an hour later got a message that the food would be delivered in 45 minutes waste of time garbage restaurant 
love love love this white pizza with tomato broccoli and spinach would have never stopped if it wasn't for the police always there thank you
i've used dielman on several occasions over the last 10 years or so divorces remarriages in law move ins and in law move outs i initially needed a moving company that also offered onsite storage facilities dielman fit the bill perfectly had items in storage for about two years and they were able to retrieve and deliver my furniture to my new location with little notice also they were kind enough to take storage payments over the phone years ago the staff has always been courteous and prompt some of the crew members have been the same movers on subsequent jobs even with their offices located in missouri and our recent moves in illinois i trusted their company enough to be a repeat customer regardless of the distance movers typically charge not only an hourly rate but travel fine also i've had great experiences with dielman which have coincided with many planned and unplanned life changes 
always double and triple check your orders i am here a few times a week and things are always missing from my pick up and dine in orders if i had a choice o wouldn't frequent this location as much food and service are fine but the inconvenience of reminding them to provide what you ordered sucks 
all i can say is it is about time there is a stellar indian restaurant here in town and you guys-it's wonderful not only are they offering some typical dishes like veggie samosas chicken tikka tandoori offerings ect but they also have non- traditional items i ordered through doordash and got the goan fish curry i lived in india years ago and it is truly reminiscent of dishes i had and long for if you are tired of the humdrum chicken tikka masala you might want to take a ride to avon i do believe they are going to be a hot destination my only trivial complaint--they did not send utensils oh pooh 
ok i stand corrected so just be prepared to pay 24 above the price of your drinks for state taxes and it's not the establishment's fault that they have to charge that much 
this place is a hit and miss service is always great but the food is mediocre couple months ago i got the chicken parm catering tray and it was great this past week i got the dinner platter and it was frozen processed chicken nugget shaped disks it wasn't even real chicken for 13 bucks 
i've seen two shows here now both reasonably different one was a cabaret show starring betsy wolfe and a showing of a christmas carol both experiences in this intimate cozy theatre were perfect for one thing the size is such that there's hardly a bad seat in the house being on the extreme edges might be a little frustrating but other than that you can't really go wrong comfortable seating and reasonably roomy for the space also it's just so darn cute can't beat the history either if you get a chance to see a show here take it worth the time you spend 
this place had so much potential but they completely fell down on execution space is great vibe is great and menu is good they were really busy today but have an online waiting list system which is nice however when we sat down things started to fall apart the menu i was given had a glop of some white creamy food in the fold which was gross and made it hard to read a couple of the items we ordered and when food came out it was cold interestingly i heard the table next to us complaining about their food being cold too it also took a long time to get my beverage from the coffee bar and husband's coffee cup was left empty for far too long as well we were asked twice if we were ready for the check so at least there was some attention paid to us overall food was good not great but the mediocre service and the inability to bring the food out hot make this not worth the cost 
this unethical business needs to be shut down they ran my credit not one but four times without my consent 5 months later and still dealing with the aftermath do not make the mistake i did do not visit this place of shady scammers 
i've driven by their outdoor patio many times today i stopped and had a lunch special chile relleno and my wife had chilaquiles both plates were delicious the service was great it took us longer to decide on lunch than it too them to get it to our table 
this place seems like it sprang up to serve the nearby retirement community i ordered the chicken salad salad and was let down the salad came out with the ingredients placed on top in an arbitrary fashion the chicken salad itself was overly dry and only tasted like chicken if there were spices in there i did not notice 
i tried this place for lunch today for the first time i wasn't sure what to order because my usual go to was not listed in their lunch specials i normally order drunken noodles or pad kee mao because it's nice and spicy today i chose l1 with tofu basically a garlic dish with broccoli the lunch specials are served with soup salad with a peanut dressing an appetizer curry puff rice and the garlic tofu i ordered mine level 3 spicy because i was nervous about what their level of spicy means 3 was not spicy at all next time i will ask for level 8 or higher because i love spicy the soup was good a clear broth soup with lots of cabbage and some soft tofu the salad was delicious the peanut dressing was a little coco nutty and sweet and the lettuce was super cold and fresh the curry puff was also delicious and served warm with a little drizzle of sweet sauce the tofu in my dish was my favorite of the meal it was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft inside i poured the sauce from my dish onto my rice and really loved the garlic flavor just wish i had ordered it with a higher spicy level the service was so friendly here and the food came out so quick after we ordered i look forward to our next meal here for sure glad i found this place 
nice hotel and the staff we very friendly the rooms were clean and the beds were clean and very comfortable parking was ample and easy to access the restaurant was good and ample amounts of food i would stay here again 
very fresh and tasty you order on a screen and then you get your order when your name is called there are not many sauce options and i could not eat 2 of them due to a soy allergy i got the spicy garlic sauce on the side which tasted very good but pretty spicy there were not that many shrimp in my order and for the price it did not seem like enough there are also extra 50 cent charges for more types of toppings which can add up the egg noodles were very firm and tasted fresh i thoroughly enjoyed the meal but just wished there was more shrimp overall very good for a healthier option and vegetarian vegan options 
met my girls here for a pre-christmas get together tea party i'd never been to the oe so i set my gps and let it take me to the location right in the heart of tampa from the outside the building is pretty non-descript it's an older edifice in the middle of a split street across from university of tampa there's free parking down side streets or you can pay to park at the church i found a free spot and made my way inside i had no idea i could enter off of the back street so i walked all the way around to the front on kennedy which was fun as i was dressed to the nines inside i was stunned this place is huge there's a gift shop a book store a buddy brew coffee and a champagne bar wow we waited a bit for our reservation and then were seated around the fountain in the atrium lovely really but loud especially when one party of young women decided that we all needed to hear what they were excited about seriously everyone in the eatery turned to look at them the tea menu and spirits menu was nicely appointed i chose the silver leaf jasmine tea and the regular tea service as did my friends though their tea choices were different our waiter was polite and kind and when he brought the food it was delightful there were finger sandwiches of peanut butter and jelly curry chicken salad turkey scones with clotted cream and jam and an assortment of pastries that were decadently delicious our experience was excellent and we'd come back any time 
i ordered from here on seamless they accepted my order charged me for it and lied about delivering it i tried calling the location and the phone number listed is a 555 number which isn't even a real number then when i called seamless customer service they were able to get a hold of the restaurant the restaurant told customer service they never received my order so why lie and say it is delivered if it was never made in the first place so you can take 40 for no reason absolutely horrible experience 
went here with the love of my life pro tip - she ordered while i nabbed a couple of spots - this place is popular for good reason so seating is competitive i had the egg and cheese sandwich with an iced coffee the egg and cheese sandwich was delicious and a very unique offering of a classic i recommend the iced coffee was served with a metal straw so bonus points for loving our planet 
it pains me to even write a review for applebees because i hate to admit the fact that i have been here it's even worse to think i've come more than once but not by my own desire of course simply to join along with the company of friends or family who for some odd reason wanted to go here there really is nothing appealing about this restaurant and there are just so many better places to go in the area every time i've been to this location the service is always subpar one time a server was flat out rude to the point that i still remember it to this day last night's experience wasn't much better while the server was okay he did not go out of his way to make it an enjoyable evening my mom and i were there together and wanted to split the 2 for 1 drink special we asked for a diet coke with malibu tall the server went to go put in the order came back a moment later and said they can't do 2 for 1 on tall drinks ok then short it is none of the food i've had here was ever good most of it is greasy or just flat out unappealing meanwhile my mom ordered a soup and salad for dinner i ordered nothing as i had already eaten somewhere else beforehand while waiting for the food i noticed an odor in the air similar to that of dirty socks which must be coming from the 30 year old musty carpet needless to say the decor here is totally out of style looks like it hasn't been changed since 1994 it needs a major update in here overall the food is lacking the service is lame and stepping in this restaurant is the equivalent of going into a stinky time machine no thanks 
this is a college area so i expected the meal to be decently priced and it was i stopped in for breakfast on a wednesday morning it's a real cute trendy spot the waiters were super i had big l and no that's not his name but we chit chatted and that's his nick name now haha super funny and very attentive i ordered the french toast which was topped with strawberries and whipped cream turkey bacon and cheesed eggs all for 8 00 can't beat that also had a glass of orange juice i would recommend this spot for meeting brunch alone hanging with friends pretty much anything because the volume was low and it was not very crowded slightly small portion but worth it 
outstanding restaurant halibut beet salad pastas and cheeses were nicely put together helpful nice staff friendly environment strongly recommend 
first off i want to start off by saying i love dutch bros i live in phx and i was so excited they opened one here as for this location the drinks are much too sugary i always get the same drink - iced kicker i have been to this location multiple times and this is my third time in a row where i have gotten a drink that has a ton of sweetener one time we got it half sweet and it was still way too sweet this has only happened to me at this location 
this place is my cheers - i've been coming here for years and it's still the same perfect mix of irish pub and dive bar peanuts on the floor darts in the back fireplace in the corner karaoke a couple of nights a week and live bands most of the rest of the time can't think of anything i'd change 
when you think of plastic surgery centers you probably don't think of a lot of men going to these places but i can tell you that in my visit there were a few men getting consultations from dr watt i wasn't doing any surgery just some spruce up juice dr watt was personable funny and put me at ease quickly it was a breeze and i feel and look great why be miserable just go 
good customer service but our app was room temp when it came out we had the crab and cream cheese fried dumpling thing and it was not good at room temp sushi rice was a little dry and the kani salad cream they used was so thick and creamy it was difficult to stir 3 stars for good customer service 
honestly there's not much else i can say about shake shack i've been to the king of prussia location and now the rittenhouse location of course rittenhouse is much smaller and does not offer as much seating but you're still getting the same great burger for the first time i tried the fries and loved it it was a great compliment to my burger i didn't order a shake but i did try the lemonade which was refreshing on a very warm day in philly service was cool and so was the ac overall if i'm in the area and in the mood for a shack burger i know where to go just a note if you want to drive to this location parking is murder i ended up parking on 19th and market street and walking a few blocks if you're somehow lucky enough to grab one of the two parking spots in front on shake shack well kudos to you 
i ate here once upon a time and had a good experience so i made reservations for two at 9 30 on a saturday morning before graduation it wasn't too busy and there is a lot of nice seating outdoors the best part about this place is the coffee it stands alone without creamer or sugar pretty well and i love it i also really love the chicken sausage we ordered bacon chicken sausage tuscan scramble and biscuits and gravy i am a biscuits and gravy fanatic and love making it at home too their biscuits and gravy is the pits the gravy is thin and the taste of the gravy is mediocre- not to mention the dryness of the biscuit be careful if you only want biscuits and gravy order it as the side or else you'll get eggs too the tuscan scramble is pretty bland which is too bad because we were thinking it would be packed with flavor service was fast and friendly and they kept my coffee cup full i've heard their sweeter breakfast items are better so if we go again that's what we'll try 
love the food the high ceiling and natural light the online ordering app the location the people-watching don't love recent increase in prices i spec'd out a 14 pizza to go yesterday 35 really the wait staff vary in quality but there always seems to be a manager close at hand to solve any mishaps 
we stumbled upon this place after we got off i-4 to get gas on our way to tampa i had previously researched the place and was more than excited to give it a try the wines were really good as i have learned a lot of the florida wineries will mix their grapes with other fruits because of the weather conditions not being ideal for grape growing so if you are more a fan of dry european wines i would stay away a really beautiful location with a lot of outdoor seating that we would have capitalized on if we stayed for longer they have food and beer as well for those not interested in wine the staff were all so friendly and welcoming which really helped make our experience better 
definitely one of the best restaurants in the neighborhood we have been there twice and will return many more times the burgers were great the menu has much to offer service was great and the atmosphere was lively great neighborhood meeting place it's a must-try 
i live close to cafe ol and have been there 1000 times i always get the tomato and mozzarella sandwich with a green tea of iced coffee because it's delicious and i'm a creature of habit something came over me today and i ordered the skakshuka and it is the most amazing thing i've ever had a total game changer i would eat is for breakfast lunch or dinner 
back when i used to wait tables down at the french quarter i would usually come here for lunch when i had a double and had an hour or two for lunch - and it pretty much became tradition for me on saturdays - when i had a double i would take that lunch break at samurai or come a bit early if i had a night shift for their lunch special i would come in my work clothes and they would always treat me very well which was a plus but there is some weird unwritten code of courtesy that extends to each casual restaurant when the waiters from nola galatoire's mr b's etc come to eat lunch around the french quarter their lunch specials are pretty generous and are inexpensive three rolls a salad and a bowl of miso soup came around to 10 bucks my friend who came with me once and a while ordered the regular menu items - she had the soft shell crab which was suprisingly well cooked however i can't comment on their specialty rolls - i kept it simple with their box sushi and normal sushi rolls everytime i came here the food was consistent - however reading the other reviews here it doesn't seem so quite possibly because i ordered the normal rolls speaking of the rolls - they are quite large and they taste extremely fresh they offer a selection of asian and domestic beers and sake service was always friendly and fast the restaurant itself i've never seen busy so it was nice and clean and quiet - it could use a little rearrangement though but admist all of the loud french quarter touristy restaurants it's nice to have this quiet place to come to and sit down and eat 
i had a particularly great experience here tonight wife ordered fish tacos and i got full rack thai ribs with roasted potatos and thai snap beans amanda was an excellent server and adam is a very astute manager great experience thank u all
i'll update service is getting better i just avoid peak hours because they get slammed i do love the food lemongrass bun potstickers shrimp soup you must try the shrimp soup it sounds kinda weird until you try it with the garlic and rice and spice it's like medicine for your soul 
this place is awesome my son had the alligator and shrimp gumbo and i well i had drinks still full from previous place lol i had the gator bite drink and also the choc bread pudding it was all delish the atmosphere is great the decor music pretty rad but hats off to our bartender melanie who gave us some great suggestions and places to check out 
i have eaten at husk in savannah several times and had a great experience we are visiting nashville and where hoping for a similar experience upon arrival we went to the bar for a cocktail before being seated only to run into a very smug bartender who refused to serve us he made this decision rather crassly and instantly we were just a happy group and he instantly put a black cloud over our night so husk you lost out on our business and probably will for my lifetime we went to southern steak and oyster and had the good time we as consumers deserve i travel for work and pleasure and in spending hard earned money to go out have a great experience and great food so if this smug bartender reads this or any of husks management your missing the point i won't spend a cent to deal with your attitude or judgement we went on had a great night with establishments who know how to treat their patrons your smug attitude will only get you so far in life young man 
boudin balls appetizer left a lot to be desired i also got the fish of the day and it came out raw manager fixed the mistake for shrimp and grits which were okay better food to be had elsewhere bar was noisy crowded service was thankfully friendly 
the food company a poem your turkey and artichoke on white farm bread beckons me to it when i need to be fed roasted peppers and spinach in my mouth linger better than a rousing game of hide-the-fingers your gooey bars brownies will transcend generations how does that gross bread company place have multiple locations chicken salad number one is no joke either it will stop the spread of club foot aids hopefully justin bieber blts are delicious the roast beef is best who can hate a business that accepts american express this southern sandwich fare is my personal fantasia even though i'm 80 sure the owner is from asia the tea room salad is another gem i suggest but the southwestern salad isn't so great - give that one a rest the parking lot is small the restaurant is tight if you go at noon you'll be elbowing whoever's on your right it's club la vela in my mouth minus all the skanky hoes just up the street from crow's nest kroger and joe's if you're a chicken salad fiend this place is a must for you with food co in your belly you'll be writing your own haiku fin 
i've really fallen in love with this place it's small and cozy and you can tell the owners chefs owned operated by a lovely husband and wife team truly care about food feeding people and making those people happy ebony was our server both nights we visited and she is awesome she had me laughing all night long and had great suggestions on desserts and appetizers the duck confit appetizer we had the first night changed my life and the trout entree i had this time was perfect we had some very picky people in our party this week and they enjoyed everything too get a bottle of wine and try chloe 
the restaurant served up some good eats and drinks the fried rice with the tofu was delicious i truly enjoyed the spicy ness of the dish the management owner was very accommodating if in the are i would definitely stop in 
today november 11 2018 veterans day i went to sports clip to receive a free veterans day haircut as advertised only to be told that if i purchase the 20 00 deal i can receive a discount and that they are not offering free hair cuts to veterans or i can also receive a seniors discount well i left and went to great clips they advertised free hairs cuts to vets and came through unlike sports clips whose ploy was to get you in door and offer discounts 
the food was absolutely amazing and so creative i will be going back for sure we loved the cozy feel of the place and had great service the music was also perfect created a really good vibe 
mediocre french food comes to ardmore i went with my wife and daughter for restaurant week i ordered the prix fixe meal with melon gazpacho steak and creme brulee my wife had the stuffed squash blossoms and bouillabaisse my daughter the french onion soup and an entree salad everything was fine and nothing was outstanding or even above average the french onion soup was a bit too sweet for my taste but not objectionably so the gazpacho was too thin and too small a portion even for a prix fixe item the bouillabaisse broth was ok but nothing special and to my mind the broth is what should pull that dish together instead of feeling like an afterthought the creme brullee was a substantial portion and had a nice texture but after a lackluster meal it didn't change my overall impression the service was solid nothing took too long and even on a relatively busy night the servers were attentive and polite 
they must have been having a bad day when we were there the beignets were not fully cooked or something very disappointed 
omg this is the only place you'll want to go to have a piece of furniture reupholstered now this place is in a run down strip mall and the inside of the store is a mess but who cares the workmanship is top quality we felt the price was fair good selection of fabrics our antique chair had never been reupholstered we found a fabric and pattern that looked perfect for an antique piece the underside had completely fallen apart they replaced all the components and material 
cozy interior with excellent service and delicious food my big complaint is that i ordered 29 chicken entree and it was tiny nothing like spending 60 on dinner and leaving hungry chicken is not expensive so i don't get it it came with 4 tiny carrots a 3-4 very small chunks of beets 
favorite nashville bar it's nice to come to a local spot and not get bombarded fave nashville spot as long as it stays under the radar i will continue coming here 4 nights a week
zamzows employee's are the most helpful knowledgeable and friendly people ever this just goes to show zamzows as a company is doing it right i needed to vaccinate my dog so he could stay overnight at a doggie hotel and didn't realize he was behind on a couple of shots i was shocked when they told me i could pick them up at zamzows and administer them myself's the staff were all so helpful and nice especially aurora who walked me through the steps love love this company
you know how people say you can't mess up breakfast these guys can had the steak and eggs and yes it was horrible slab of meat no flavor at least the cooked it correctly but what difference does it make if it doesn't have taste 
we were in nashville last weekend and received a few referrals to give this place a try plenty of seating the line moves very quickly we sat in their upstairs seating area where they have multiple bars and live music playing solo acoustic the artist was very talented i had the brisket baked beans potato salad and the memphis rub wings with alabama white sauce the brisket was really good moist tender with great flavor the baked beans were fantastic and shined out among the other sides the rub on the wings were good but the alabama white sauce was not very tasty i've had and made a lot of alabama white sauce for wings if you're going to throw out a white sauce it needs to work well to enhance the flavor of the chicken will definitely recommend to others and will visit again 
service sucks i waited over 20 minutes for our waitress to bring our change back from our bill another waiter had to come bring out our refills because our waitress was nowhere to be found jacky the hostess was very rude and didn't even give us eye contact the waitress brought us out 8 ranch cups when we didn't ask for that many the male manager was the nicest of everyone and i saw him helping other tables out also worst location we've been to our waitress was ashley and manager was david 
it took me a while to get around to dining at august but after our recent visit i can't recommend it highly enough it's undoubtedly one of the better restaurants in a city full of great places to eat yet it lacks the pretension one might expect i'm fairly certain john besh wasn't on the premises as the evening we dined at august was during the opening weekend of domenica the newest restaurant in his empire that's not to say that the menu or the food suffered from any lack of attention or inventiveness quite the contrary our perfectly-paced la carte selections included a house salad with point reyes blue cheese and pumpkin brittle gnocchi topped with a savory crab and truffle sauce and a delicious soft shell crab special our party had a great table in the middle of the beautiful dining room that managed to retain an intimate feel even as the restaurant grew more crowded the service was thoughtful and attentive with a special touch at the end of the meal to recognize a birthday no detail - even the washcloths in the restrooms - is too small and it's the accumulation of all the little details that make august a great place to mark a special occasion or to make a special occasion out of an ordinary evening in new orleans 
great overall experience smart and attentive sales and financing staff found me a great deal on a 2016 tiguan even with a negative equity trade on my 2011 jetta excellent and expansive vehicle selection comfortable and welcoming environment please visit these guys if you need a new vw 
dined there last night prior to the theater it was my first tapas experience in months and i thoroughly enjoyed it try any of the flatbreads - just sensational the beef empanadas were also very good i was the only person my party who had a drink the syrah was excellent leave room for the home-made rice pudding our server was very helpful with great suggestions we will return 
customer service is very poor lack of knowledge meaning absolutely no help will no longer go to any meineke i went out of my way to write this review and suggest you don't either 
rybread is wonderful on this visit i had the greek salad and the savannah sandwich turkey with cranberry sauce and mayo the salad was outstanding everything was very fresh and there was a perfect balance of romaine lettuce a fresh roma tomato cucumber feta very thinly sliced red onion and excellent kalamata olives it's enough for a meal itself the sandwich was piled high with thinly sliced turkey cold cut and the cranberry sauce was very tasty the staff were also very friendly 
i guess you get what you pay for this past weekend was the first time my fianc and i have ever been to new orleans i really wanted to like this hotel given the easy access to must see attractions and the reasonable price of the hotel room however i just couldn't get over how unclean our hotel room was now i'm an outdoorsy type of girl who can rough it but when it comes to a hotel room i do have just a few expectations for starters clean sheets i pulled back the blankets upon arriving and found human hair everywhere yes a little hair isn't going to kill me but it was obvious the maid had not changed the sheets between guests secondly clean floors the bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in weeks and the third thing that really bugged me was when i went to the front desk to get some extra towels i was told they would send some up to the room i go up to the room and immediately receive a call verifying i had requested towels twelve hours later and i still never received any towels now i don't know if they were just understaffed or if management figure guests will get so drunk they will not notice either way i really hope they can get it together and provide a better place for tourists to stay the one positive thing i have to say about this hotel was the valet guys they were extremely helpful and friendly i plan to give this hotel one more chance the next time we visit hopefully by then they will have gotten it together as far as the cleanliness of the hotel rooms 
i've been a fan of daves dogs ever since he opened up his milpas location years ago once i heard his goleta location had its soft opening i knew i had to go got there after work around 930 and they were busy just like expected however the wait was short and after i got my 4 dogs i dug in i got 2 western 1 dave's and 1 sb style all the dogs tasted just as i remembered from his catering and milpas location delicious afterwards i got their corn on the cob that had crushed hot cheetos on it the corn was super sweet and i believe they used lime mixed with the hot cheetos to stick it on the cob i plan on going again tomorrow but this time trying out some more of his new menu items instead of doing my usual orders only 
i walked into this salon requesting a nail design and showed the technician 3 different designs instead of just saying look we can't do this at all she tried to do her way which looked completely ridiculous she didn't understand english and i surely couldn't understand her i had to assist her with the design otherwise i would've walked out with only a polish nail i suggest instead of wasting a person time just be honest and admit such request can't be done i also didn't like how my phone had no signal in this place and the parking good luck 
we were looking for a new place for breakfast and thought we'd give the old horseshoe grill a try it was pleasantly surprising we had good service really good breakfast and the prerequisite bloody mary yum 
this is a large place so don't let the wait time scare you we showed up around noon on a sunday and was told the wait was 20 min 3 min later i got a text saying our table was ready score it does get a bit hot and stuffy inside and some of the tables you sit at will be shared - if you don't mind that then you'll enjoy yourself 
probably the best all around steak house in st louis have eaten at alot of steakhouses throughout the country - charlie palmers the palm peter lugers gibsons mortons - and citizen kane's ranks right up there with the best of the best the only thing preveting a full 5 star rating is the noise and space issues can be a bit loud and a bit cramped but the steak can't be beat i also like the fact that sides come with the meal and not a la carte recommend the rib eye they do it right 
well worth the drive out of town it's a very subtle flavor i suggest the halibut enchilada with a lite mango sauce ceviche tostada and or the fish tacos yummy you might want to ask them not to dice up jalape o into your order it gets real hot real fast also ice cold modelo's on tap 
dined here for the second time today but will not be the last sports bar atmosphere tvs and sports memorabilia but families would be very comfortable great food reasonably priced wonderful staff that were very patient and helpful 
i always make sure to visit cheesecake factory when i'm in st louis and in terms of food quality it has never disappointed the fried mac n' cheese is always superb and the sauce on every dish i've had is perfect not to mention their drinks which are always top-notch but alas all is not completely perfect visited this location on 7 14 7 15 and on both visits the floor was exceptionally slick not like water slick but almost like there was a grease of some sort on the floor the first day i assumed it was because of the rain outside and thought nothing of it but when we returned on 7 15 the floor was exactly the same it felt very dangerous walking on it i began to think we were the only ones who noticed until i heard the table behind us mention the same thing maybe the cleaner used on the floor caused it either way i can't imagine that someone hasn't slipped and fallen by now service on 7 14 was very lackluster the server didn't seem to care at all about us but it wasn't that big of a deal because the service on 7 15 was phenomenal as it usually is as always will be back 
i love this place i have never tasted a better dinner roll it was like a zeppole without the powdered sugar i am pretty positive that on that particular night my vegan self went out the window as a result of said bread but it was worth it i had the green plate they replaced the mushroom and squash au gratin with brown rice and more greens so i could be vegan for the rest of my meal and my boyfriend had the pasta special which he very much enjoyed upon leaving we made a reservation for my valentine birthday and i cannot wait to go back 
not the friendliest staff but i guess they are going for the philly-new york vibe where you can take it or leave it i'll take it food is good so it'll keep me coming back they have good slices and daily specials hopefully this place sticks around for a bit 
i say i'm risk averse the higher the stakes the less likely i am to take a chance out of fear of disappointment however i had a good feeling about julienne after a chance conversation with their wine buyer at a social event and he talked me though the menu so i went there for my birthday dinner with the fam and a friend absolutely no disappointment the woman who tended to our table and food i suspect was one of the co-owners she was knowledgeable on all our questions very friendly and put up with us taking photos of everything two of us opted for the 3 course tasting menu including myself the other two went a la carte the great thing about the tasting menus is that you can choose your own adventure or let the kitchen decide for you i knew i wanted the foie gras torchon to start and let the kitchen lead me through the rest of my meal my friend put on the culinary blindfold and had the kitchen select everything plus wine pairings my father who wanted to try everything ordered four full size items a la carte between the four of us we were served nearly everything from the menu and about that menu - a short list of selections and everything was perfect the restaurant strives for high quality locally sourced ingredients and the small menu highlights what santa barbara's bounty is best at the moment i love it our favorites foie gras torchon a bargain at 13 yellow tail tuna tartar with lots of roe fried squash and crispy pork belly lots of photos uploaded too other patrons included young groups some older couples and some solo diners people who live to eat rather than eat to live and it was full on a thursday night when so many restaurants right on state street were sparsely seated cost came out to about 60 head before tip and no need to be a stuffy headed foodie to eat here we laughed and joked all through the meal then lingered over sparkling water and coffee long after the bill was settled good vibes 
classic huge sports bar with labyrinthine interior that sprawls all over with large outdoor patio areas as well this is right next to tropicana field and a good casual stop especially if you are with a large group their wings especially garlic parmesan are large high quality and worthy of their reputation the burgers are also good and more backyard bbq type authentic than expected they have many specials i went for the grouper fingers well worth it solid 4 stars for the solid kitchen work and mega sports bar vibe a definite downtown st pete classic 
i've had brazilians all over the city but i'd never consider getting another one from anyone but shelly at bombshell shelly makes me feel comfortable at each session i've never felt weird about having all my genitals exposed in front of her because her jolly personality makes me feel like i'm having a visit with an old friend her dedication to customer satisfaction is inspiring i love bombshell waxing 
this is a real place expect to be treated like you walked into a very comfortable fine trimmed lively environment you'll never feel forgotten as far as dive bars go this is a classy very well established tavern there's a mix crowd so it goes 
the last time we were here we got pho it's one of the best bowls of pho i've tried in a while and its also pretty cheap too maybe 6- 7 a bowl we always come here every time we go to reno the broth is cooked with a lot of beef bone which makes it taste better than most places we'll be back soon i would recommend going to this place 
blast from the past what do i mean by that well there are old items form my childhood for example the old original candy land game as well as brand-new items the place is really clean and kept neat it has some really neat items to go in there and browse however the majority of the items are overpriced and as far as the staff members go they seem to be a little more preoccupied with other things well i guess when it came down to it if somebody really needed help and asked if they would help i never asked for help because i was just browsing as far as items that you could go in there and check out would be the kids crayons i like them because they're fairly decent price and they have a bunch of different colors my kiddo really wants the macaroni and cheese crayon i believe you can get 20 crayons for a dollar so which one you're out and about and you want to see some really neat go check it out 
i have eaten at most of the restaurants in philadelphia which are vegan or vegan friendly by far this is the best restaurant considering price location and food choices the restaurant has faux meat products but it is exceptional in its use of real vegetables and fruit choices i highly recommend the meal that allows you to choose two or four of the 8 to 10 vegetable choices it is spectacular i especially like the asian eggplant dish and the japanese pumpkin choice they can't be beat the location along south street is convenient but not surprising the seating is limited and the space is small however it is brightly decorated and cheerful anyway the staff has been 100 friendly and helpful we really enjoy our times there if i owned a vegan restaurant this would be it 
this was my first visit and last my family and i were here for easter brunch this past sunday and by far it was the worst brunch experience i've ever had in the tampa area 1 - we made reservations for the 2pm seating and weren't seated until 2 40 and were the very last group in the lobby that was seated the buffet ended at 4pm but last call was at 3 45 it barely left us much time to really enjoy the food incredibly disappointing 2- while waiting to be seated i witnessed several tables not being cleared fast enough to let groups be seated quicker and on top of that the wait staff would wipe the tables and let all of the food fall to the floor and underneath the tables our table had waffles pieces and other crumbs underneath why not tell your staff to wipe and hold something underneath to pick up the crumbs gross and makes the place look dirty 3 - the staff was visibly overwhelmed by the crowds and completely disorganized they were taking forever to clear plates on the tables resulting in a delay in bringing enough clean out on two occasions i had to use the small dessert plates to get food our waitress didn't make it to our table until 15 mins after we were seated after waiting a while we just got up and went to the buffet instead of waiting to be greeted first 4 - on top of that the waitress came to our table rushed and disheveled and brought our bill to the table very early and told us she needed to clock out to go to her next job and was in a hurry who i later ran into in the women's bathroom having her co-worker curl her hair with a curling iron - so random so not only did she rush serving us so she can get her hair done in the bathroom she rushed to close the bill and when she came to the table and we didn't have the payment ready she had an attitude about it i will say the waiter that helped her at our table afterwards was far better and saw how displeased we were with the service and tried to make it right by coming to our table often to check-in 4 - the overall buffet was very mediocre the omelet station was good although the guy making the omelets kept disappearing for one reason or another and because they only had person making omelets pastas and carving the roast the wait time was excruciatingly long unlimited crab legs were nice to have included but the other buffet food items were dull the biscuits were hard chicken wings soggy and just not enough food selection for the price overall the service was terrible and the brunch food quality wasn't high enough to make it back over there again why bother offering a 2pm seating when you know that you can't seat people at that time it doesn't allow the last seating enough time to really enjoy the buffet i would recommend that if anyone comes here during any holiday sunday brunch to avoid the last seating or just go somewhere else 
in life you get what you pay for this is a basic hotel with cheap prices so don't expect anything fancy it is not updated and the double beds are small but luckily i had my own bed the tv is old and did not have a lot of channels we either watched some form of local and or national news a million espn channels or the weather channel however the hotel is in a good location not too far but not too close to the french quarter there is an ihop next door as well and a mall the staff was excellent and the breakfast was more than i expected from a hotel breakfast it was always crowded at breakfast but we still managed to find a place to sit and eat 
visited at the end of restaurant week and had a great meal we stood in the very very small entrance area waiting for someone to notice us which every waiter did but the lone hostess was busy filling water glasses even as a second and third couple tried to come in behind us with nowhere to go definitely make reservations - i can't imagine you'd have success as a walk in i have to say the environment was not my favorite other reviews have mentioned it but we might as well have been on a double date with the strangers next to us there's intimate and there's overcrowded the food really saved this for me the restaurant week menu had a lot of options which was nice and my boyfriend and i made sure to order different items for each course the fontina stuffed meatballs were good though the cheese was a hard glob in the middle that i could barely notice or taste the real winner on the first course was the grilled artichoke and whatever magical dipping sauce it came with delightful for the main course i had the market fish black bass spinach fingerling potatoes and my boyfriend had the scallops with risotto the bass was the perfect portion size and i cleared my whole plate by the end it was just so tasty i couldn't believe the scallop dish though came with 3 measly scallops - and they weren't even large it's like they were decoration to the risotto very disappointing dessert consisted of the salted caramel panna cotta and nutella gelato the gelato was the clear winner though my distaste for the panna cotta came simply from not realizing the dish had a pudding-like texture overall a good experience but with so many other restaurants in the city i likely won't be back at this one 
not the best the drinks were really sweet the flavor was not there i won't be getting another drink from here anytime soon 
about to park at our favorite place and valet says we can't park our own car literally a few feet from a spot i have never seen valet there and i choose not to have my car parked i would recommend to management to give customers their choice of parking sadly they lost my business that night 
everything about this restaurant is mediocre besides the service- which was really good dining area is nothing special however they do play very loud italian music which ads to the ambiance but also was a bit too loud food was average nothing special i got the very spicy penne al aribiata and my friends got margarita pizza which were both just average not great but not bad the waitress was really good though and always made sure my water glass was always full unfortunately i will not be back though as it wasn't anything above average 
i was very happy when i found him on yelp at first he answered the phone and showed up onetime to 2 of my houses and completed the work then i tried to schedule an appointment with him again to complete more work at the same houses and he did not answer the phone he requested additional information which was given to him and never call me back or answer any text very disappointed just when i thought that i found a very professional and trusted electrician 
yum yum yum pizza in my tum i wouldn't waste a crum i always want some cuz frano aint no bum
came here for the oyster special it got pretty busy so our flatbread took a while but the oysters kept coming promptly and were delicious so all in all we had a great time we are def coming back also they have a good selection of beer in case you are not a wine person and the name of the place scares you 
the food was fine as usual but the drive through staff suck plain and simple i ate here twice this week and both times left me wanting first visit was just ok the second one i felt as if i was an inconvenience i could barely hear her mumbling at the speaker and when i got to the window she was to worried about the other people ordering to engage in any pleasantries no hi or here you go or your total is or anything not one word just one outstretched hand for my card and the other hand thrusting my order at me 
my husband and i just left there we walked in on a wednesday at exactly 7 29pm you would have thought we had walked in at 10pm all of the chairs were on top of all the tables but three the three available tables were dirty there were two little boys maybe 4 or 5 years old wandering around twirling wash clothes and pretending to wipe tables they must be the owner's or manager's children when we walked in and saw that scene i asked are you open the waitress said you're good pick a table we were the only people in the restaurant and maybe 1 guy sitting at the bar we picked a table right next to the table where one of the boys was on a chair cleaning the table top he kept kicking the back of my chair and our table was sticky child labor ain't what it used to be my husband asked for an ice tea the waitress came back and told him they were out of ice tea that's code for we already dumped it all out to clean the ice tea container because we are trying to get out of here we felt so uncomfortable like were intruding on them trying to close up the place that we told the waitress we were leaving we went down the road to 55 south where there were plenty of people and great food and drinks tip don't come after 7 00pm or you will be annoying the staff who are trying to get out of there 
1 make a baby 2 make sure not to name it river phoenix 3 boy or girl doesn't matter 4 allow them to patron this saloon starting at age 13 building a foundation of rock n' roll 5 by being the flagship musician of a burgeoning music scene by the time they're 22 they'll have turned indy into the portland-of-the-midwest 6 thank the dorman 7 repeat do all over again there's an upside to our circle city being chopped up by major freeways bedroom communities are really really really bedroom communities defined boundaries isolated neighborhoods create boundaries for regulars to retain their neighborhood dives and the boundaries create a romantic aura for those venturing into the different neck of the woods something that makes cities cities are prosperous individual neighborhoods that can almost sustain themselves entirely alone and a local dive bar is essential in that prosperity the dorman street saloon is that lynchpin of solidarity for the cottage home neighborhood in indy my fellow patron jiminez says it hasn't changed in a year and i'd imagine it's been this way for some time now this dive bar is inspiration enough to build other businesses around so we all thrive together an endless gift of a jukebox a single pool table that charges a single quarter for a rack a single bar of abundant charm from the bartenders don't fret you're not on the set of a tim burton picture -- those slanted shelves the slanted floor under the pool table and the strange angles in the bathroom are all just new forms of expressing age right dorman to living life a little bit crooked to aging well to making sure the dorman street saloon is woven through all our living aging 
el manantial was delicious sonoran bacon wrapped hot dog with a bit of crispy skin beans and salsa and grilled onion and mustard and mayo oh my the guero pepper was a very pleasant surprise bacon wrapped and stuffed with two kinds of cheese seems like mozzarella and cheddar first time on a friday at lunch hour my current favorite place for sonoran hot dogs seven clean tables seating 4 people each in the ample shade three more in the open air authentic ambiance provided by busy southside intersection i asked about the name 'manantial' and was told they focus on quality and are like a pure mountain spring five stars 
great parking spot for port of tampa cruising i was very happy with the service to the port they were waiting for us both coming and going and wisked us off to the ship promptly it's literally two minutes from the ships and far less expensive than port parking i highly recommend the facility and will use them if i sail from tampa in the future 
the drinks were the bomb the food was pretty solid and the game idea is unique and well executed i like that they subtract from the playing fee if you get food and drink it's a fair deal will go back and recommend others to check it out 
very nice pet supply store locally owned support your local community owned business very knowledgeable friendly professional staff store is clean and organized well it's a joy to spend money for the fur babies in the very nice business thank you sweet feriend
if you grew up in camden you've been to donkey's and you know and love it well no this is not a philly cheesesteak its a camden cheesesteak first they come on a poppy seed kaiser roll if that is an issue then don't even bother for me their onions are the best and make the sandwich they are a sweet onion some may feel they are over saut ed but i love them the meat may not be the largest amount but it is very high quality no fat no gristle no veins it is tender and melts in your mouth the fries are crinkle cut always hot and delicious this place is a part of the camden legacy and well worth checking out and enjoying
a wonderful establishment in riverview the front office staff as well as the medical staff were professional and top notch the office itself is very clean with a modern vibe dr rodrigo was very thorough and took the time to explain everything to me he was friendly and professional and i would highly recommend interventional pain specialists to anyone they have a life long client in me 
love this place delicious always nice and you can tell it's authentic always fresh ingredients 
incredible we hired a cleaner previous to clean green and they did a mediocre job unmotivated lazy and missed a lot then after careful research we hired clean green and were amazed at the results they steamed the wall next to our stove to remove the grease splatter they cleaned our oven to the point it looks brand new they got in the nooks behind our toilets desks and bed to really clean everything we had clean green come a bit before mardi gras to do the initial cleaning deep then have had them about every two weeks thereafter nice cleaners very punctual and a high standard for clean hire them if you can 
i've ordered from here 3 times now and it's always been an easy and simple process shirts come out great and are done by next day i highly recommend 
i get pedicures all the time my wife requires it so that i don't rip the sheets so i can honestly say i can give an unbiased opinion of a nail salon with they said this is the worst nail salons i've ever patronized and if it wasn't for the gift certificate i wouldn't have come a 2nd time rushed even when there wasn't any other customers i wonder why that is 
probably the worst service we've had in clayton also the four burgers we ordered we're not cooked correctly two were sent back and still resulted undercooked beef lastly the server had a horrible attitude and lacked the needed attitude for even a mediocre dining experience 
smoothies are delicious we stopped here both times coming to the french market first time i got the tropical smoothie my husband got a mango smoothie second time i got the virgin pi a colada which has vanilla ice cream it was so good my fave so far the guys were quick made the smoothies perfectly i don't like my smoothies too watered down they weren't 
used to love their pizza but tired of the attitude of the ignorant workers called this evening to order asked for zucchini fries they're actually eggplant fries my bad and someone named dave yelled tell them to go to applebee's called them out on that comment and dude on the phone said in a patronizing and whiny tone dave stop that needless to say they've lost our business idiots 
delicious german food amazing atmosphere if you are looking for a delicious dinner w live authentic entertainment this is the place to go i will definitely be back 
incredibly friendly great store furthermore best dog grooming ever it's one on one versus having your dog in a cage all day with most groomers ---and done in an hour or so brittany does great work we recommend this place to everyone 
i fell in love with a sectional in here prices are not low but since i was hunting for one for the new house for a while we decided to shell the big amount and go for it i got samples which can only be checked out for 24h not so great since you are shelling big bucks for it figuring you can mull the options for a few days nope you can check out return and check out again but they were kind and let me keep it for another day it was all great until we got to actual ordering of the sectional suddenly many many many issues came up sales rep quoted me wrongly for prices then they couldn't find the sectional to order then the sizes they gave me were wrong on and on and on i decided i still wanted that sectional was so hoping nay crossing all my fingers for no mistakes in ordering then 12 weeks due date of ordered sectional then over paying for sectional i didn't order crediting it back a serious sh t show customer service i almost took off the head of one sales person steam was coming out of my ears marc and ashley are very proficient only ask for them if possible fast frw 12 weeks and i got my sectional 75 delivery with assembly no payment upon delivery as discussed ahead had to suggest just paying with cc over phone instead of their suggestion to come down to shop on day of delivery to pay remaining balance face palm who does that nowadays 3 stars for the furniture only sectional is one of the best pieces of furniture in my house not sure it was worth all the trouble with this staff but for sure very beautiful and comfortable 
i've been looking to try out t-swirl crepe since passing by some of their locations in manhattan and chinatown philadelphia i didn't know until searching through yelp that they just opened up a location in my backyard erm well my town's downtown since they advertised a 20 grand opening deal i decided to go check it out for lunch in terms of a haddonfield establishment the opening hours are quite generous open late in the morning and closing close to or at 10pm nearly every night i decided to go ahead and get a savory crepe they create japanese-style crepes made of rice flour so all the gluten intolerant folks rejoice my choice was the angus short rib reminiscent of korean bbq sliced beef in a nice savory jam-packed rice flour crepe overall a good crepe though it got to be a little soggy towards the bottom due to the generous dressing that they used inside and the time it took for me to eat it i went straight in without utensils eating this like one of those new style hot pockets and slowly unfolded it as i went again since it was a little soggy towards the bottom and there was quite a bit of dressing i left a bit of the bottom so i didn't get dressing all over myself i visited t-swirl about 9 days after it's grand opening and i will note that service was quite slow for a sunday afternoon there wasn't a rush or even a lot of people in the store when i ordered and it still took a good 10 minutes to create and i only ordered a crepe they have more than just crepes sweet and savory their selection of asian style drinks are also quite plentiful but i did not get a chance to try it overall glad to have this place in town when i'm feeling a crepe as a snack or want something to drink that's not coffee looking forward to coming back 
great service friendly employees from door to table the food delicious good to bring your kids too 
this is guaranteed to be your new favorite pizza place theres nothing like it in the valley great local beer great pizza great service 
is it bad that instead of having breakfast i just want to go back to glass house was what my fiancee said the morning after we first visited this enchanting place i laughed at what i thought was hyperbolic praise but a moment later realized wait i felt the same way we found glass house during our 4th of july visit to sb we were drawn by the botanically sprawled victorian aesthetic replete with candles and fire pits imagine john muir had just married queen victoria and you are celebrating in their backyard where they installed an outdoor watering hole home to the most capable cocktail mercenary west of the atlantic that would be alvaro you won't have to imagine him because he exists as one of the talented mixologists here he's a cool dude--he even sent us his list of favorite sb spots go talk to him and you'll probably want to take a mixology course after really we learned so much about the history and usage of various liqueurs that we felt inspired and that really is the key word here everything from the decor to the undeniably high quality of every drink evokes inspiration you'll feel it when you order the berry old fashioned wascally wabbit earth day and smoke break i can't do them any justice with words but hopefully their names alone would urge you to visit although i will say that if you ever were so enamored with camping cabin lifestyle that you would want to somehow experience it in one drink--go get the smoke break you'll taste and see why this is the best complementary bar for santa barbara and was definitely the best destination of our trip and no we did not go back during breakfast we went during lunch and dinner for both of our remaining days 
right before i was leaving to move back to the east coast a friend in sf told me about this place she said that i had to try the schmitter it only took me 2-1 2 years but i finally got to try one first off you just have to love the area super cute shops delicious restaurants easy parking and this awesome local bar as we walked in you kind of felt at home and comfortable pretty small bar with a couple of tables and not a ton of sunlight coming in everyone in there seemed to know everyone else we were the two out-of-towners but they were friendly enough great beer selection easy menu with not a whole lot of fuss the schmitter was well worth the wait it was huge and drippy with delicious sauce mouth watering grilled meats onions it seriously was just a fantastic sando 
this place and porta via are the only places i will eat pizza in nashville for those of you who are complaining about the traditional use of olive oil on your pizza i suggest you never leave tennessee you will be disappointed with any traditional food and should just stick to shoneys and meat and threes maybe i was lucky to be brought up knowing what good food tastes like as opposed to the guy that says the pasta at olive garden is better but the pizza is unbelievable authentic and is a welcome addition to nashville's slowly but surely growing restaurant scene the rest of the world and even the rest of the country eats food prepared with fresh ingredients that did not come out of a freezer box i suggest those of you that do not like bella napoli's food either broaden your horizons and discover the excellent food that nashville has to offer or stick to frozen microwave dinners that you were undoubtably brought up on 
been here for 3 hours and nothing at least give my dog some meds for seizures and let's us go i understand it's an emergency clinic so wait times may vary but this is ridiculous 
i was up in the area and stumbled upon this place thank you google maps first glance the menu is so much more expensive than anything i have seen recently and we moved from sf area this rivals their lunch prices -- if i had seen the lunch menu before i sat down i don't think i would have stayed veggie soup was very good light and fresh tuna roll-- uh i felt like i could have made it better at home i ended up poking out the tuna and leaving the rest behind smoked salmon sushi- solid but i shared it with a fly tamago egg -- i forgot how much i like this sort of sweet it was my dessert end price 21 19 service was meh i was one of 3 people in here will not come back 
if i could rate it a minus 5 stars i would we've spent more time here than on the road everytime we come here they never complete the work on the list and have broken things that weren't broken before always seem to have to pay the deductible for things that were under warranty but aren't because we wait months to get it serviced our coach leaked the first weekend we got it home took them 2 years to figure that out they kept saying it didn't leak even though i took pics and finally video of it running out never buy another thing from them again 
i wish i could give more than three stars but this place has went down hill the quality isn't worth the price anymore the food is mediocre the cheesecake is still delicious but not sure if it's worth the price it's a place you go to once a year if you're in the area 
waitresses offered terrible services seriously while i was sitting and waiting for a delayed airplane one of the waitresses came over me not offering menu and said it's not allowed to sit here if you want order beer go to the bar how rude and no one is sitting and eating at where i was i wonder if she knows what tip is made of anyway big mistake big mistake 
this weekend i was called by a directv telemarketer offering me 55 hd channels for 30 days free then only 4 99 month if i choose to keep these channels as i am telling the lady that i am happy with what i have and do not want this 'free' offer she disconnects my call the next thing i know i receive an email thanking me for signing up for this 'free' offer and if i wish to opt out to call 800-288-2020 i do so and am on hold then transferred multiple times over the next 20 minutes to learn that i needed to call directv at 800-531-5000 incredible i then call directv and after 15 minutes i am finally opted out of this 'free' add-on which i never wanted to begin with what a scam 
warning friendly staff but poor housekeeping standards 3 rooms on 3 floors and all gross gave up after staff checked the 3rd room before assigning it to make sure it was clean and it wasn't much better than the first two photos show filthy showers and tub in all 3 rooms not just stained a quick wipe with a tissue revealed that the dirt could have been cleaned but wasn't stained carpets with food particles on the floor in all three rooms seem to indicate a systemic problem one room had trash and an old tv remote under the bed one room had what looks like pubic hair and pieces of popcorn in the sheets one room had hair by the coffee pot items on the floor range from a pecan blue trash a piece of dried meat a citrus seed plastic from a clothes price tag and a variety of unidentifiable items other than assigning another dirty room no resolution offered not up to marriott standards 
i love this place i've been eating here for over ten years the food is great and so is the environment when i was a teenager i came here a lot with friends and eating here was the highlight of our weekend i'm 27 now and still love it it's great that it's open late you can drink at one of the bars next door and order food to go or just show up at 3am on the weekend they are open till 4am on fri and sat or even have it delivered i absolutely love their balsamic vinegarette it's been somewhat of an obsession of mine lol i can't find anything like it on the market and can't recreate it myself i asked the wait staff a few times over the years and they always tell me it's a secret recipe they changed it a bit over the years but not so much in taste it is just a bit creamy now i always order it with everything i eat i put extra on the salads pasta salad dip my sandwiches in it etc i recommend the sampler as an appetizer it is awesome my favorite sandwiches are probably the eggplant and portabelo sandwiches i used to eat the ham and cheese all the time though i know ham and cheese doesn't seem exciting but is really good aioli on it is really good there pizza is really good and even though i'm not much on burgers i like them here too 
great neighborhood bar the servers are very friendly and they have a great beer and drink selection recommend the lobster roll it's warm 
their food is good but it definitely seems overpriced for what you get and the atmosphere you eat in it's a good place to grab a quick lunch during school days but it's not the kind of place you want to spend much time in 
went there with the kids on easter the owner actually brought little easter gift bags for the kids i thought that was a nice touch and an indication of how this restaurant seemed to function the food was very good and authentic the menu also has some other central american dishes when we left there was a well-dressed gentleman who bade us a good evening and told us that he was providing security even he gave the impression of competence and care i look forward to visiting this restaurant without the kids 
was excited to try this place but unfortunately left without eating or drinking had a group of 6 with a baby and we couldn't fit around a single table largest table accommodates 5 even though there were two tables next to each other we could have pulled together they wouldn't let us so we left kind of a weird rule it was fairly early too and the place was half empty don't go hear with more than 5 people if you want to dine together 
we ordered the bazooka limon guac the queso condido con carne and 2 taco tasting platters which included the sea bass grilled beef chipotle chicken pibil pork and the crispy mahi mahi tacos the food was all really good the guac was definitely different and i only wish they had given us more chips although i guess we could have asked for more the queso condido con carne was delicious and very hot in temperature but again i wish they had provided more flour tortillas i had the chipotle chicken taco and the pibil pork taco both were really well balanced in terms of flavor and texture it was the perfect amount of food to accompany the pitcher of el vez margaritas that we also ordered the margarita was strong but good next time i would try another version of their margaritas yes they also have the photobooth we spent 3 to learn that it is impossible to take any good pictures with 5 people in one photobooth but it was fun trying 
my wife and i went to bella brava and did not know what to expect we really enjoyed ourselves we ordered a stuffed chicken breast meal and split it between the two of us the portion size was just right when we did this and the food tasted excellent we sat outside and really enjoyed being able to people watch our server was amazing and we actually got her name so that we can ask for her when we go back int he future she knew the menu so well it was extremely impressive my wife and i eat out a lot and i have to say the server we had was one of the best we have encountered in a long time we finished off our meal by splitting a tiramisu that was delicious we will definitely be back 
this is a charming little market restaurant if i've ever seen one this joint has been in the anastasi family for 4 generations a fact that you can observe if you come for dinner on the later side say 8ish and during the course of your meal everyone filters out except the family hanging out at the bar while you finish up your meal when you have settled the bill someone will let you out of the now closed restaurant and you are one your way - full satisfied and intrigued by this little spot i haven't been here for the fish market part but it sure looks like an authentic buy something they caught today kind of spot for fresh fish smells like it too we had the three-course dinner special and loved it i generally prefer pork and steak to fish but was absolutely satisfied with my fish and even had some mussels yum probably not the best date location if you are towards the early stages of a relationship but if you are comfortable with adventures and each other trust me this place is worth it enjoy 
ok to start this restaurant is old school jackets required for men at dinner and definitely has a feel of good ole southern money meaning mostly old white people here however don't let that stop you the food here is phenomenal we had a few bumps as we were getting our meal started it took about 5 attempts to actually get any bread and then another 2 attempts to get butter however our server maja was quick to acknowledge the error and promptly brought us an order of the garlic bread now let me stop here - skip the regular bread and order the garlic bread it was so light and crispy with an intense and incredible buttery garlic flavor definitely a good way to start your meal we tried a bit of everything and nothing was bad for starters we had both of the gumbos go for the seafood gumbo it was the better of the two for my entree i went with maja's recommendation which was the redfish blackened with the crab and mushroom topping i had never had redfish before but this dish was just superb i tried the brabant potatoes - essentially deep fried potatoes covered in a garlic butter they were crispy with a fluffy center dessert - we went with the bread pudding and the mocha panna cotta skip the panna cotta it was good but the bread pudding is everything 
if you're in the mood for falafel you're better off getting one from the many carts outside of it it was decent there wasn't any rice when i went at 2pm and they didn't have any pickles that you could put on your falafel which feels wrong they had interesting toppings but nothing to write home about 
this is a great place to enjoy simple food prepared with great care and ingredients served to you in a prompt manner at a fair price definitely one of new orlrans great unsung eateries 
person working the customer service center hare was just unpleasant not just to me but almost any customer whom she did not recognize as a regular customer even people that came in for interviews at 9am were greeted with unpleasantries just a simple hello would be nice assistance on international shipment was subpar was quoted one price initially and the actual cost was 4 x's that amount i avoid the ups store due to added fees but at least the service is much better will try and avoid this location 
if i could give this zero stars i would stay away from this place pros no roaches or bed bugs that we could see anyway reasonable prices for the worst fleabag ever cons shower curtain falling down no towels numerous bugs including flies spiders and fleas smoke holes in bedspread overflowing trash outside terrible wifi one guest left because his front door wouldn't lock sketchy people outside our door drug activity unprofessional staff non smoking room smelled like smoke dirty bathroom the only reason we stayed was because everything else in town was sold out very unsafe environment no breakfast
i've been coming here since the 1970s and it never disappoints unpretentious old school comfort food served in a throwback diner atmosphere the signature dish is the munch burger which is outstanding but i typically go for breakfast best bacon egg and cheese sandwich in town hands down get it with a biscuit also if you find yourself in there on a day they're offering ribs as a special don't hesitate very meaty and moist keep doing why you're doing munch's 
they had a great brunch on sunday you can do the brunch buffet which includes oysters cocktail shrimp omelette prime rib salmon among other options you can also order off the menu for brunch the staff was very attentive and great for conversation street parking was a little tricky but there is a garage that is free on sunday about a block away 
i drove out of my way to go to this place a coffee was amazing the people had a great attitude i texted their homemade sauce for the pork it was really great i hope these people expand and grow their business i will definitely come here again next time i drive up to tampa coming from miami
i had high hopes for this restaurant when we first arrived we were told there was a 20 minute wait which was fine however they really don't have a section for you to wait in so we just stood outside after we were told are table was ready we got to our table and out horrible server arrived she asked if we wanted drinks i we told her what we wanted to drink she left the table for 15 mins never got our drinks until i asked her when she was walking by she gave us our drinks we ordered our food appetizer because we used the time we were waiting for our drinks for so long i asked for a straw which took another 10 mins to get it took them 35 mins to make for chicken fingers which is what the call an appetizer when the appetizer arrived they didn't come with a plate to eat them on or napkins i almost canceled the appetizer order because of the long wait which i should have because 11 90 for 4 chicken fingers is a terrible thing to pay for however this isn't even the worst past of the experience our food arrived which took 35-40 mins my son ordered french toast which was cold my other son ordered pancakes with chocolate chips and marshmallow which one would assume would be cooked in to the pancakes no they jus heated up frozen pancakes and sprinkled hard marshmallows and dropped chocolate syrup on them i ordered a 3 egg omelet it looked like a 1 egg omelet it was really small our server came back to ask us if we needed anything and my some asked for a milk she went and started to have a conversation with some one for 10 mins i had to remind her that we asked for a milk all in all this was a terrible experience our waiter was the worst waiter i've ever had she was not attentive at all she seemed distracted the food was extremely disappointing the extended waits for basic food shows the lack of preparation and ability to create food in a timely manner i only gave this place one star cause it's sunday i just left church next time i go to brunch i'll go to first watch 
we must have done here on an off day because we went on a recommendation what we had dim sum shrimp ch'io mai beef ch'io mai shrimp in rice noodle crispy pork taro bun cream bun hot and sour soup chicken and corn soup sticky rice white rice menu item chicken lo mein the overall impression was the same even by our 9 and 6 year old where he hell is the flavor chicken lo mein a staple meal had minimal flavor and every bite was bland at least it wasn't heavily oily the sticky rice took one bite and stopped the buns if you like steamed flour as your only ingredient then go for it the pork not fresh and not crispy the white rice cmon how do you mess up white rice the soups hot and sour was tooooooo salty the other needed salt the service when you ask for water for the table and see that there are five people don't ask me how many glasses we need 
this place is 5 star for the tarantini panzaratti after work we order a plain pepperoni and a hot pepper piping hot and perfection 
we decided to give this place a try due to its close proximity la parada is our go-to but we thought maybe we would branch out we went on a friday night with our son we waited a full fifteen minutes before the waitress took our drink order we decided to go ahead and place our food order at the same time in hopes of speeding things along the food took forever to arrive all the while our toddler was getting restless and hungry when it finally did everything was wrong as in enchiladas in place of tacos and the total absence of our child's food who needed it first simultaneously they grossly messed up the group sitting across from us my eyes panned the room and many people were rolling eyes and shaking heads we were never asked if we wanted more salsa refills and i was never offered a water i took my check to the counter where no one stood and waited and waited it was a loooong aggravating experience never again 
fairly clean terminal area with lots of seating and charging stations both usb and ac it is not terribly crowded however i'm traveling through during an off-peak time and i can imagine this side of the airport getting very crowded during peak travel times the major downside is that you have to take a tram to this part of the airport and food options are quite limited see below for a list of food vendors the other issue is that there appears to be only one set of working restrooms in this area another set appears to be under construction - however there are signs explaining this both in the area and before security restaurants food airside are pei wei chinese starbucks to the left chick-fil-a new york pizza burger 21 in the middle ducky's pub-style bay coffee tea plus a few convenience gift news stores
i have to say that my first experience with them was out of this world the friendliness and the 110 assistance from all the staff on my husbands birthday dinner party of 20 people that i only expected about 13 was handled with such professionalism and courtesy to each one our guests as they arrive and they accommodated us with room and waiters and handling each other in a timely manner very clean environment and everyone in our dinner party was s impressed that many will and have come back to dine there i had the everything nachos very fresh and the chicken in the plate was the talk of the table i have to say that it can feed 4 people everyone's food ranged from hamburgers that needed to have a little more seasoning and flare to enchiladas and specialty plates on their menu everything was worth while thank you for each one of the staff on 2 13 6 pm-10 pm we spend all that time at the restaurant never feeling that we were rushed or in anyone's way i recommend this with a 10 start option and rating and the mango margaritas are to die for you need to stop by and this is from a guest who's mexican american from california 
very beautiful cafe it can get crowded at times but the line moves and the employees work fast we all had an assortment of pastries and coffees and everyone was very pleased so happy to have a place like this in gretna 
best donut shop in st louis and that means something coming from a donut expert like myself the donuts are so fresh so if you don't get there by 9 am you may miss out on the cinnamon twist that's okay you can land gently on the best apple fritter you will ever find the chocolate old fashioned is pretty good also as is the vanilla sprinkle oh heck i could eat every donut in that freaking place and yes the husband and wife are awesome as is their daughter who is helping run the store now bring cash because they don't take plastic 
so went to this place looking forward to some tasty pizza the interior of this place is slightly above a disaster there is an open kitchen which looks thrown together but hey i've eaten tasty food from much worse looking establishments ordered a pie with pineapples and garlic don't knock it until you try it and cheese fries with wiz the pizza itself was certainly above average and the fries were run of the mill but good the problem i had was they didn't actually have garlic on my pizza not that i could actually see or taste anyways and i'm certain i was charged for it -1 over all decent pizza but only for takeout delivery 
as a penn graduate student who lives in powelton i was excited when this shop first opened i've been disappointed by the lack of restaurants in the area and was happy to see falafel one of my favorites open only a few blocks from me my girlfriend and i went one night back in february we split the hummus and each ordered a chicken shwarma the hummus was lack-luster at best it was very bland and oily in fact the entire meal was tainted by oil and grease our shwarmas were equally greasy and sacrificed fat for flavor i believe the shop owners are from egypt yet the food was disgusting i think they were trying to cater to the drexel student tastebud and missed the boat on what americans like flavor was completely toned back it was the worst falafel house i've ever been to we both felt completely sick after the meal seriously i believe the people running the store a nice i just don't see this place lasting for very long unless the constant turnover of drexel students can support it in addition the bland interior and flashing neon lights on the outside are as unappetizing as the food quite literally even if they paid me for the meal i wouldn't return 
stop in here about every couple weeks for a quick salad for dinner the wait staff has always been polite quick service sure beats cooking i've never had a bad experience here 
i recently purchased my first house and the roof had been put on by usa roofing a couple of years ago about a month into living at the new home we had a leak in our ceiling in a straight line during a storm this happened a few other times usa roofing honored the work they had done for the previous owner and came out twice to inspect our roof free of charge the first visit they did maintenance and the second visit they determined that the roof wasn't the culprit for our leak at all we had some downspouts on the front of the house that were clogged and it was causing water to come down through the fascia and soffits they cleaned the gutters and did not charge us a dime i must admit i was embarrassed but the workers were incredibly polite and so was tammy the owner we plan on getting gutter guards with them in the future because their customer service was so amazing 
if i could give it six stars i would hands down the best mexican food i've had and i've trawled every corner of la oc and sd for every hole in the wall mexican place i can find i've had some amazing mexican food across california and texas and i have not found a place that feels quite as perfect i had the cheese with chorizo chiles nortenos roasted chile peppers stuffed with shrimp and my wife had one of the burritos no complaints i usually find something but i can't think of a single thing wrong with it i was stunned by every bite--perfectly cooked and seasoned flavors in total harmony pleasurable twists and turns to every dish endlessly customizable with the array of delicious sauces so good it's incredible don't miss this even if you think you're a pro at finding good mexican because you've gone to every hole in the wall and taco truck in your city--you haven't had this before wildly good 
i usually don't like chain italian restaurants mainly because they are expensive and nothing ever tastes all that good but this place is actually really good my mother-in-law loves this place and takes us here often i think the main thing that makes it great is the one waiter tony he is the best and actually knows what we order and usually when we sit down he brings over our drinks without even asking and he aways gets it right i am not very adventurous so i order the same thing all the time the chicken caesar salad in the menu is calls it the best chicken caesar salad i always add ever on to the end when i order it because it is the best ever also tony started making it and he adds a little bit of ranch and it makes it have this wonderful creamy taste i like the rolls to and they just recently started keeping them warm or something because they are really moist and fresh for some reason my wife usually orders the pizza or chicken tender meal and broccoli and then splits it with our daughter the tenders are either fresh made or a really good packaged chicken because they are so so good i have had a few things on the menu besides the salad and everything is really good i like the baked tilapia overall this place is a really great stop for lunch or dinner make sure you ask for tony 
best soup ever try the floridian bean soup it comes with a side of cuban bread amazing it's all i ever get now when i stop here 
if it weren't in the galleria it would get 4 stars but the people all look like thugs in the mall the food is always high quality for chain restaurant cuisine and boy are the portions huge
breakfast was amazing the eggs were so smooth and the croissant was like butter beignets were way better than cafe du monde and bigger 
this market doesn't have the selection or low prices of la asian markets but it is easily my favorite in sb helpful staff interesting selection and clean layout they have a selection of sushi-grade frozen fish or they can get you the same fish served at sushi-teri across the street which they also own delivered fresh by the pound 
this place is awesome must get when at the reading terminal market no matter what time of day you're there you can watch employees hand roll frost and fill these donuts as you will more than likely be standing in a huge line there are some classic flavors and there are some unique flavors this place is known for their cream filled donuts which are great and not too heavy what's even better about these donuts is that they are not overly sweet and will give you a huge sugar rush simply put these are some of the best donuts i've ever had 
again rook delivers what ever i order it's an incredible experience that gives my tastebuds and brain a pleasure beyond most kitchens in indy and in all my limited travels 
went here for a work lunch and had the fish tacos and guacamole both were excellent i will have to go back and try a margarita after work next time 
we took our extended family here for thanksgiving the food was really good everything tasted great and the salad bar was awesome there were big problems though our server was nonexistent we had to wait long periods of time in between drinks or getting any attention i made a comment and nothing changed another problem was that the men with the meat and the knives stopped hitting our table after a while and would not even come over when we asked i'm sure it has something to do with their logistics but it made me wonder if they were trying to show us the door either of these issues are irritating but combined with the price i expected more i would not return to this restaurant unless i had a deep discount 
i had my husband's 30th birthday party at benny the bum's earlier this month they exceeded my expectations we got the 30 per person open bar bracelet package i knew we would have a good time with our friends regardless but i didn't expect the great service we received they worked with us helped us choose the best package for our party the manager servers were very accommodating cleared some tables so we could move to the other side of the bar when our party got larger than expected they also checked back frequently to make sure our guests had enough to eat drink the bartenders were also very attentive we didn't have to wait long at all each time we ordered drinks the drinks were strong the food was perfect there was a great mix of people of different ages races we had such a great time we already decided to have my birthday party there too i would definitely recommend benny's to anyone looking for a drama-free atmosphere to have a party or even just to hit the bar dance 
hpd's customer service is stellar wink and melissa are a class act if you're nervous about buying a diamond online stick with these guys they take excellent photos and videos and the amount of information and knowledge they have about each stone is unbelievable i wouldn't buy a diamond today without aset and is images and a reputable lab grading report ags or gia which they provide for every diamond they have on their website i trust these far better than i trust my own eyes they also have access to a wide variety of mountings including designer settings my new beverley k pendant with a crafted by infinity center diamond is out of this world wink also runs winkcz com where you can get impeccably cut cubic zirconia if you're not into diamonds or if you just want something different i have one of his gorgeous octacz stones and can't even describe how beautiful the cut is they're not cutting these anymore so whatever he has left on his website is all there is left in the world to buy 
a buddy and i ended up on bourbon st at the end of a tuesday we surfed in and right out of about 4 different places before winding up here this was the best of them at first glance and we ended up having a great time the girls were friendly place was comfortable and as clean as they get drinks were right although a tad pricey if you're looking for a reasonable place to hang with a friend or two this could be it i'd go back 
cool building and absolutely delicious cold brew on tap perfect for a hot summer day walking around philly 
if you are looking for authentic native american made turquoise jewelry pottery sandpaintings kachinas and more then this is the place to be 
would give 0 stars if possible they overcharged my account by 20 despite me making a payment on time on a different card they lock you into a 1 year contract and give you difficulty about canceling join planet fitness instead
i called a couple places and i got the best customer service from oliver they wanted to upsell for a service plan but i went with the coupon from the mailer as i can do a lot of the easier maintenance myself they sent out a technician named ryan wilkenson he was prompt clean courteous and did a great job he also gave some great tips and advice on how to keep the system running well and serviced i highly recommend this company and this technician 
beautiful beautiful location and excellent cappuccino and i drink a lot of capps also the seating was very nice i grabbed a stool by the window and it was the comfiest stool i've ever sat on that may sound silly but it enhanced the overall experience great job rival bros 
we have had this spot on our hit list for months so it was a very special visit today to finally check out milk and honey bakery in plainfield it was worth the wait and drive from downtown located off to main street in downtown plainfield milk and honey offers a wide variety of coffee drinks using tinker coffee local and delicious loose leaf tea baked goods like cookies whoopie pies and sweet and savory pastries i was especially impressed by their expansive lineup of pastries that included kouigan aman croissants pistachio chocolate fruit danishes ham and cheese croissants and plenty more the space is charming and offers a handful of tables fun ambiance music great natural lighting and ddelicious smells note that the wi-fi can be spotty parking can be found on the street out front and is easily accessible bonus i love that they had little samples available on the counter as soon as you enter all the staff i encountered was very friendly and welcoming can't wait for my next visit and to try more of the menu 
we arrived at 4 30 to take advantage of friday night happy hour and early bird specials hubby and i went to bar area andy asked bartender if it was ok for us to sit at a table she was friendly and said sure i'll get a server the server came 5 minutes later and scolded us for not following the 'please wait to be seated' sign that was posted at the dining room entrance although there were no other patrons in the bar service was extremely slow i had to ask about specials i had fried flounder which was a 3 oz curled up piece of fish with bland mashed potatoes but perfectly cooked green beans and carrots also came with a nice size cesaer salad my husband got chicken parmigiana which came with an alfredo sauced pasta that was not good didn't understand the departure from marinara anyway i heard they have really good wings but not sure if we'll return 
most overrated ice cream shop anywhere the location and parking are horrible you are lucky to get out of the parking lot without having a crash when you walk in there's really not much room to form a line servings are very small and pricey staff acts like they're doing you a favor by serving you they have some unique flavors of ice cream but the quality is very average i have requested malt powder multiple times and they just don't want to listen to the customers the interior decor or lack of it is very cheap 
we needed a special dinner to celebrate our anniversary and decided to order pickup from mercato byob we order the garlic bread ricotta gnocchi and the orecchiette it was delicious i can't wait for mercato to open up again everyone should support and order delivery or take away 
i checked out the loco pez in fishtown before which was great and randomly ended up at this one food itself was pretty good but service was subpar and i've never been so thirsty in my life afterwards decor is really nice and much more spacious than the fishtown one nice upstairs space too relatively simple menu which was easy to navigate nice tequila selection we had a pitcher of margarita for the table they never asked which one we want so i assume we got the classic for the first time ever i heard people complain about a margarita very sour couldn't taste the tequila at all either which i guess is a good thing we considered saying something and asking for a redo but between the 6 of us we just finished it taco prices are actually pretty reasonable which is my main complaint about this sort of mexican place good amount of food and it was pretty good had the chorizo and potato enchiladas and mushroom quesadillas come with rice and beans and lettuce and nice salsas for the table pretty flavorful and a good amount of food the mushrooms were my favorite service especially for the check extra chips and change was super slow unfortunate since we were 1 of 2 tablets upstairs so it couldn't have been that hard to notice us surprisingly good food reasonable prices and a nice decor eh drinks and meh service a reasonable place to check out but if you want better food head to the italian market and if you want better drinks and service head to center city 
fantastic service by tatiana accompanied by really good food there seem to be a lot of negative reviews about the service but we had a truly good experience here there were four of us and we decided on this place for dinner before the blues game the friendly host offered us a table on the enclosed and heated patio such a nice option on a cold icy night it was actually warmer out there then inside the restaurant we had immediate and attentive service between the four of us we had the cheese curds impossible melt iceberg wedge no bacon which they brought with bacon and quickly corrected grilled chicken wrap and a regular burger comments by our guests were that the food was all really really good and the portions are large i would highly recommend giving this place a try 
best lattes i've ever had friendly staff and delicious chicken salad sandwich on sourdough bread 
sat outside for dinner saturday night service was top notch food was amazing mushroom soup and mushroom crepe were outstanding the veal was the best i've had thank you to the owners for making us feel part of the family 
pretty cool rooftop bar outdoor lounge it is at the hotel epicurean good date spot they have a nice cocktail list and the bartenders make them well they also have a small food menu i did not eat but the food looked good we were there on a thursday night and there was a nice crowd too i hear it gets packed on the weekends so i'll have to check that out there are some cool couches to chill out on and they have heaters for when it gets chilly will definitely be back 
cycle bar is a part of the yard at fishers which makes sense if you think of all the good food options there you need a place to work it off having never tried cycling with a european style bike i was very happy to receive 5 classes as a part of a yelp promotion cycle bar is a beautiful location very clean but welcoming with a bright color scheme the staff is very helpful when getting logged into class finding your bike and getting your shoes clipped into the pedals i enjoyed the class it was an intense work out with great music my coach was encouraging and i liked that she said remember this is your ride not anyone else's i think i could definitely make this a regular part of my fitness plan the variety of options and times are helpful to a working person and the overall atmosphere is welcoming 
brace yourself for my braces story i got them in my 50s that's right my 50s they're off now and spoiler alert thanks to moshiri orthodontics my story has a happy ending how did i start this jaw-journey let's just say that things were not right with my bite my dentist warned me she said this will get worse but a great orthodontist can fix you she was not the first woman in my life who insisted i needed fixing i said okay send me to the best so she sent me to the best the practice of drs moshiri father and son master orthodontists problem-solvers of the highest order yet very patient-centric practitioners their staff is terrific their offices modern and inviting free wi-fi an adult waiting area a kid video area etc but don't let those bonuses distract from what's important this team takes their work very seriously and the phrase attention to detail was invented for their method does that mean this was fun for me no braces are not fun no orthodontist can or will promise that this was a multi-year uncomfortable experience for me ibuprofen was my best friend and true most of my fellow patients were teen-agers but there were other ahem slightly older-than-teens among us but at any age if you're going to do this do it right was my problem corrected well you have my permission to ask to see my before-and-after photos you'll think i changed my appearance to enter a witness protection program but that's not why i did it i did it for health now and for the future the point moshiri orthodontics has my highest recommendation and now like many teen-agers i am successfully over my braces phase so next i'll be getting my driver's permit 
orange leaf how do i love thee let me count the ways - frozen yogurt flavors like cheesecake and birthday cake just to name a few - toppings for health nuts like fresh strawberries blueberries and kiwi - toppings for sugar babies like me like oreo crumbles carmel chocolate thingy's sprinkles and much much more - toppings for nut lovers like almond slivers walnuts and peanuts - and charged by the ounce wait scratch that i don't love that 'charge by the ounce' part mainly because i usually pile on too many ounces lol if you've never been before the orange leaf experience allows you to serve yourself you choose from about 10 flavors of frozen yogurt or so i can't remember the exact number because i always go in a sugar trance while there once you pick your container size and waffle bowl vs no waffle bowl you serve your own frozen mixture up - mixing flavors if you want - from wall mounted containers some flavors are standard like chocolate but some are flavors being showcased like carrot cake after filling your bowl with yogurt goodness leave room for toppings go to the self-serve topping bar and have a ball choosing among the 20 or so options again sugar trance has blocked my memory of exact details eat with gusto - and last reason i love thee eat with a biodegradable spoon note this particular spot only has one outdoor table on the strip mall sidewalk and inside are only a few lounge chairs and a few bar stools at a counter again sugar trance may have blocked memory of additional seating it's not a lot of seating but i believe most people like to create their frozen yogurt masterpiece and scarf the deliciousness in the privacy of their car one creamy frozen sugary flavorful ounce at a time not that i would know anything about the scarfing 
came here for brunch with a couple friends last sunday this place is beautiful and would be a great place to meet for happy hour or dinner i'm fact we talked about coming back some time for happy hour our server was hilarious can't remember his name and the service was great we got the beignets and a few of them were a little undercooked on the inside i didn't enjoy those unfortunately my short rib omelette came out of the kitchen pretty bland and my friend who also got it thought the same it was fine when we added salt and pepper the breakfast potatoes were really good my other friend got the blue plate breakfast and she said it was good too and we were impressed with our bellinis and mimosas only other thing i didn't like was there were a bunch of little gnats flying around our food i probably won't be back for brunch but i'd love to try their happy hour sometime 
real nice burgers happy hour till 10pm good live music i went here the first time and got myself the avocado cilantro burger with house fries the fries were slightly soggy but the burger was bang on medium well done patty on a pretzel bun oh boy aren't you my new favorite burger joint just to make sure first time wasn't a fluke i went back again after a week and this time i got myself the insanity burger with sweet potato fries the sweet potato fries were superb and the burger has now become one of the best i've had i will keep going back till i'm around this part of nashville yet to try a couple of their other burgers and hoping they'd turn out as good an experience as i've had so far 
what a disaster had a scheduled appointment at 9 45 wasn't even called back until 12 all just to get his annual shots to make matters even worse they got my dogs weight completely wrong they had him down for roughly 7lbs but he's an 11lb dog so now i'm trying to get approval on his online order for flea meds for over 10lb dogs the humane society called me back and said i'd have to bring him back in so they could re-weigh him after i had already spent over 2 5 hours in there this morning i will never go back ever 
service outstanding friendly jose waiter 20 years 100 excellence in customer service food tasty with high end spirits casual clean
went two nights in a row to celebrate my bday with different groups of friends saturday night had a really nice experience but sunday was absolutely horrible the server in the bar area was extremely rude and condescending to our whole group our reservation time got pushed back due to our party size even though it was confirmed the day before the restroom upstairs had one stall out of order went to use one that was suppose to be ok went to flush toilet it overflowed all over my expensive purse and shoes told the hosts and no one wanted to even bother to even go check on restrooms such a bad experience overall 
tori was such a great bartender really on top of everything great moscow mule's and for food try the gator balls they're actually chicken and they're so delicious cx
i got 6 meals for 15 because i used a code to get 45 off of a meal plan my coupon discount code is awhi-jr9 if you want 15 off of a meal and 45 off of a meal plan when you order on the app please note the code doesn't work in store you can order on the app then get it from the store to take advantage of the savings now about the romesco chicken the chicken and sauce are divine and the mushrooms paired with it is delicious i wouldve given it 5 stars but i hate kale so i wish they'd make it with collards or something other than that it's delicious
just a visitor going through the area and my buddy and i wanted something light it was either this place or japanese and we thought hmm maybe not seafood anyhow i can see why this place is busy in a city like reno this place is probably some of the best thai you can get not in north america and the price and portions were quite reasonable my friend got the pad thai which he uses as his plate to judge others i'm a bit more picky because i can make a pretty good pad thai at home i choose another dish that was a little more complex sweet chili paste with veggies and meat i thought it was good unfortunately i didn't have anything to really push the menu like crispy pork but that doesn't mean i wouldn't come back here to try something else 
today i decided to order takeout at this little restaurant right near my house i ordered the chicken tikka masala with basmati rice and also opted in to getting the bullet naan which is stuffed with jalapenos and cilantro i didn't know what to expect since i've never had indian food before my mind was totally blown at how awesome this food was it was so flavorful and full of spices everything was great together and separately i will definitely be recommending this place to my friends and family and i will most definitely be back to try the many other things on their menu 
nice atmosphere great steak bites appetizer friendly service a warminster must see dining experience
so very happy with the patio window installation that was done in 2016 enclosed my three season patio but what has me writing this review is the follow up service heat and cold did some damage to a cap on the outside i called this morning was told that someone would call and they would have someone out this week they came today and already fixed by 2pm so awesome nice friendly guys too if i ever need to redo windows in my home or do another project - i am calling these guys again 
i used i -75 today they were great professional courteous polite tim bob and mark were awesome came in went straight to work made sure we were happy with everything i am highly satisfied thank you 
worst experience ever i used this cab thru access ride with mta driver today cab 24 took 30 minutes to find me at work i know he went past the building 3 times after he picked me up i noticed the gps was giving incorrect information and i corrected him needless to say i didn't know the system was still searching for the pick-up location let's cut to the chase within 3 miles of my home the driver was in the wrong lane he i mentioned this to him he went ballistic yelling and screaming how i need to shut up and how i was talking over the gps for the third time he was throwing his hands in the air calling me disrespectful he then called i guess his supervisor jordan and proceeded to complain about me as if i was not there i then yelled i was still in his cab and all i wanted to do was get home jordan instructed him to take me to my destination which he did without incident never ever ever want to see him again 
the pizza ordered for carry out was so o ercooked and dried out that it tasted like cardboard called management and that was a joke i am sorry you feel that way i will tell the gm 
absolute tourist trap uninspired employees with super long lines and boring to even a 4 year old rides half of the rides are equivalent to taking a bus around a parking lot or joining grandpa on the riding lawn mower for 5 mins you can dig a hole with a front loader for 3 mins and then the next person can fill it in rinse and repeat the highlight of the trip was a tiny arcade my suggestion is to spend the entrance fee on a few tonka trucks for your toddler or take them on a tour of philly or nyc to see real cranes and construction sites 
i enjoyed this place a lot local museums are always hit or miss but johnny cash just has such a great story and this museum actually has a pretty fantastic selection of memorabilia and actual items from johnny's life it's tourist friendly and well organized and there's a patsy cline museum right above it too great way to spend a few hours and a little more authentically nashville than the kid rock honkytonk 
first time to nola so maybe a little enamored by the charm of the crescent city but cafe amelie was a great experience beautiful setting in a french quarter courtyard had the smoked salmon blt excellent 
becca is so sweet she is professional and courteous so thankful she served me i will definitely be coming back
slow as ever my boyfriend and i have been sitting here waiting for 28 minutes and didn't get complimentary bread and salad until the server got nervous that we were waiting for so long no salad though no one refilled our water we did get out calimari appetizer on time at least but i'm upset that we have to wait for our food for so long and my soda has gone completely flat at this point fresh seafood and bread but that's about it even when we walked in to ask about our reservation no one took the time to acknowledge us until 2 minutes after not sure if staff is trained well or if they're still working on managing timing or any hiccups but i also felt odd that the server thought i order bacon wrapped scallops instead of the shrimp and scallop marsala odd i did like their food in the end however but wish their staff was a little more warm and not as slow maybe next time i will them another try i do think their seafood is very fresh 
we have never had hot pot before and we had an amazing meal and an amazing experience erika helped us navigate the menu and recommended a great balance meal that the whole family enjoys i would highly recommend the combo items to taste as many foods as possible the conveyor belt was fun it had small plates so you could taste whatever looked good as it passed by we will definitely be back 
judy luu dds is the best most kind dentist i have ever seen and i am 48 years old the staff was great and explained everything in detail i had an appointment and did not have to wait i love that all dental needs can be addressed at one location i can't say enough how impressed i am with their services thank you dr judy luu 
three down and now the fourth location has been visited same awesome coffee same friendly service just located inside the renaissance hotel there is no sitting area right by the coffee shop but a couple steps away is a open air sitting area that leads out to a patio that overlooks the truckee the view rivals there marina view todd roasts all of his beans locally and has several restaurant accounts if you want some great coffee come for the brew stay for the ambiance 
when you go here i hope your server is dustin he is the best server of all time definition of hospitality and customer service he is also very knowledgeable of the menu and ingredients that goes into everything dude is legit so i've had this place bookmarked for awhile and i was super excited to eat here and they definitely exceeded my expectations so for starters we had the mac n cheese fried green tomatoes and the chargrilled oysters the mac n cheese and fried green tomatoes were out of this world so the two sauces that came with the fried green tomatoes was so good that i was smothering my mac n cheese with it also they topped the mac n cheese with this stewed tomatoes situation and that went surprisingly well with the flavors of the mac n cheese for entrees we really didn't know where to start because all of the entrees were pretty interesting we decided on the kansas ribs and i ordered the burger now i was interested in the burger because it was made out of short rib and pretty hard and it ended up being pretty goo but the ribs wow the ribs were something different i remember dustin our server telling us that it was a dry rub with a mustard vinegar base it was sooooo good like meat falling off the bone good but then that crispy bbq taste with ends it was a nice big portion as well i literally stopped eating my burger to eat his ribs i'm not ashamed so that's just the food let's talk about the drinks do yourself a favor is just order the sweet tea vodka cocktail i had 3 the drinks are really well made and coming from a person who is stickler about a cocktail job well done they also have a pretty nice dessert menu we had the tiramisu which was pretty good i definitely want to try the espresso creme brulee because it seemed very interesting i really love this place they really a great thing going here different twists on southern comfort food we've decided this is our spot whenever we are visiting philly 
i love going here and when i have company from out of state they enjoy the pizza too ever since they moved to that bigger place next door they have been slacking it orders take longer to be done the managers don't answer phone calls even though the phone is ringing nonstop so last weekend we had company and they wanted pizza and my brother-in-law was eating pizza and bit something hard he pulls it out of his mouth and it's a little screw i'm not the type of person to go into any store and make a scene it's just not me so i'll just put that review here 
wow the food here is spectacular we had peel and eat shrimp french dip slider red beans and rice seafood quesadilla and friwd shrimp and oyster po boy was amazing totally worth your visit on the water way too boot 
top tier tapas good ambiance great food place left me speechless the first time and did the same the 50th 
the food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable great advertising lead to overwhelming support which the restaurant is slightly struggling to keep up with in no time this place will be a community staple 
one amazing rip off my family took a hutch there on consignment after many months of not hearing anything we return to the store to find the hutch painted and being used as a display case the owner stated that it had sold and that she had held a check for us for several months and because we did not check back with them we forfeited our check and she kept the money we asked about whether she had called texted or emailed us to let us know it's sold and she stated no she then pulled out a policy and in fine print it states that they do not call customers or let them know when items are sold it is up to the person that brings something there on consignment to check back to see if it has sold we have put many items in consignment before at other stores and they always called or emailed us when the item has sold this is a very very poor business practice while the store is very cute and has wonderful items in it you have to wonder how much money they're making by ripping people off i would not buy from this establishment or recommend anybody else do so either 
good atmosphere good service the food was alright i must be spoiled back home because at these prices i definitely expected more i still enjoyed my dinner but i know that when people start asking for steak sauce then it isn't that good beautiful location in the city but i won't return for mofe 
is this company still in business i placed a deposit for a trolley in july and now the phone number is disconnected and the website is gone help 
love camp bow wow pet sitting services our petsitter joyce is wonderful with our cat and keeps me posted with texts pictures 
i googled mexican restaurants in the south jersey and this place popped up it was really busy but a good vibe cool atmosphere we ordered the nachos and they were so good i thought they could have had alittle bigger of a serving of them but good for the price i got veggie tacos and brussels tacos omg soooo good my son said the korean tacos were delicious i we had the street corn which was so good overall the food was really good the service was really good i will return 
food was great recommend the hawaiian roll and dragon roll would have been five stars except they played the same droning 10 minute song over and over 
we stopped here on our drive to atlanta we called in ahead of time for a pick up order the service was incredible even with a lot of traffic the staff had a system and managed everyone's orders they were even able to tell us a park where we could eat nearby with our 2 dogs the food was incredible my husband ordered ribs and i ordered the chicken my husband loved them ribs and the fries i got a side of applesauce highly recommend thank you pappy's smokehouse for making our drive more enjoyable 
on my 1st visit here a little over a year ago i was really just looking for a nice cafe to sit down and study a solid 8 hours i was really disappointed to discover the wi-fi is members only and took off visit 2- came for lunch with my sister who was in town the super green salad was amazing and perfect for sharing we also had a turkey sweet potato fries sandwhich it was pretty standard id say this place get 4 stars because you feel like you're in nyc when you walk in the entire vibe this place has going on is very unique and theres nothing else like it in tampa st pete or clearwater if they decide to get wifi access for the public i'd basically move in and never leave 
it was just ok burger is cooked in oven and not on grilled loaded fries was ok as welll
dingy hick style pub racist place that is not deserving of your time money customer service is terrible 
i never expected there to be such a beautiful botanical gem right off the road near the city of st petersburg my snowbird mom had been going on and on about this sink hole she wanted to visit during her stay here i will admit that i kept rolling my eyes at the idea of a sink hole being a main attraction but i went along with it boy was i in for a surprise towering oaks and bamboo shade guests as they stroll through all kinds of tropical vegetation colorful flowers spiny cacti a koi pond butterfly garden wedding lawn and exotic birds are just the highlights of what you will see here definitely worth the admission price and if you go through groupon it's even better i am so happy my mom talked me into visiting this sink hole because it is much more than that it's a little oasis in the middle of the suburbs i gave 4 stars instead of 5 because they are doing some remodeling to make more suitable exhibits for their birds i'd love to come back some day and see what it looks like when it's finished 
we've done 3 trips with scott and sustainable wine tours and each one has been fantastic they get access to amazing properties that are producing fantastic limited production wine that showcases the varietal diversity of santa barbara wine country many times you are tasting with the wine maker it's educational without being stuffy and overall a fantastic experience we can't wait for our next trip with sustainable wine tours scott thank you for the memorable experiences 
i frequent mikes on saturday night this past week the service was terrible i don't know why we received our meal on the house i really love this place i hope it was just this one time 
i love the outside of the building it looks really pretty and has a pretty aesthetic which draws you in as one of my friends said just because it's beautiful on the outside doesn't mean it's pretty on the inside keep that in mind with this review physically the inside of the building is very tiny there are about four tables that only fit sets of two on the right side of the food joint and on the left there's windows where you can look in at the cook there was only one cook at the stove my friends and i ordered our food they got tacos i got a quesadilla we were waiting for about 20 25 minutes before we finally received our food we originally asked for the food for here and then realized since there were three of us it would be hard to sit there and asked the cashier if we could make our meals to go she asked for our order numbers and luckily we were able to have it packaged to go which it was 10 minutes later it comes in a cute brown bag with a stamped skull and says dos tacos again very cute we walked to liberty place to sit down and eat boy were we disappointed my quesadilla came in a good portion about 4 cut pieces i know the location is called dos tacos so you only get two tacos but that really isn't enough for a meal more so a snack or light dinner until you need to eat something else my one friend's container slightly leaked out of the container and onto the bag physically the outside of the tacos looked pretty but that's the extent of it my other friend is from texas and frequents mexico multiple times a year even has a house in mexico she was very disappointed in these tacos to the point that she took two bites and then had to throw it out we decided to go upstairs and get some food from chick fil a instead i didn't think my quesadilla was that bad i took it home my stomach was bothering me instantly after eating the quesadilla go to this place if you aren't on a time crunch if you don't want a lot to eat and want a place to post on your instagram to get that look for genuine delicious food don't go here 
i have been here two times in the last 6 months the first time it was for our company holiday party the service was not great the server seemed moody and it felt like we were just one big inconvenience to her in her defense though i will say that she should've never been assigned to a large party like ours alone that was unfair for her manager to not recognize that also i ordered filet and had to ask for a steak knife after she left and didn't come back for a long time she looked at me like i asked for the most ridiculous thing the second time was last night i was there for a dinner conference for work again the server was miserable young miserable and looking like she hated her job minimal interaction with any of us guests and zero friendly demeanor this time i didn't have to ask for a steak knife though can't say i will return here after two let downs at a place people always seem to rant and rave about very disappointing 
i am a long-time customer who also subscribes to academy air's extra privilege service eps my eps annual furnace visit today was perfectly fine and the technician was very customer oriented he identified an issue that could pose a problem later specifically a noisy draft induction motor and a 12-year-old hot surface igniter on 11 1 19 they sent another pleasant technician to replace the old parts in less than an hour academy air really knows how to treat it's long-time customers 
the manager wrote the order down wrong he repeated it back and i corrected him order got to me and was wrong i called to get it corrected and he told me i was wrong if i am going to be told i am wrong i was reading off a hand written paper they must not need my money attitude from the person on the phone was horrible my coworkers and i won't order from here again 
great service and experience this was my first ever pedicure and i will for sure be coming back 
food was delicious try the broccoli crust trust me great service great ambiance love love love 
absolutely amazing the only place in yardley that caters to vegans and vegetarians and it is absolutely delicious they have a variety of these options not just one thing they're an entire menu for people with these restrictions so grateful to live so close i just wish other places took into consideration that not everyone likes to eat animal flesh while also serving avid meat eaters their menu containing meat would be so appealing if i did eat meat highly recommend 
the dirtiest restaurant i have ever eaten at food on the wall the buffet was cold tasted horrible then my husband went to pay we didn't say anything about how discussed we were the boy that took the cash needed to return 59 my husband had his out to receive the change the young disrespectful lad rudely laid the change down in front of him and walked away 
this has to be the worst mcdonalds for drive-thru or walk in service after my last visit a couple of weeks ago i promised myself i would not come back during the weekday morning every time i stop off on the way to work the drive-thru line is wrapped around the building even with two lanes you get to the window and they have the wrong order or no order at all the wait the wait is so long you want to get off line and leave either there staff needs to retrained or they do not have enough staff for the early morning rush today i decided to go in at 10 30 a m on the weekend on the way to a meeting the drive-thru line was long so i went inside the line wasn't to bad so i decided to wait the cashiers and managers were moving super slow and having casual conversation a manager opened a register i was so excited because i thought the line would move the person directly in front of me was a mcdonalds' staff member who was on break the manager served her and told me wait a minute during this time another manager was laughing and leaving when another customer grab him to tell him that his order was wrong at the same time the other manager on duty starts complaining that she is out of everything this should have been my clue to leave but i was late and didn't want to stop somewhere else for coffee it took the manager 10 minutes to come back to take my order of a medium coffee and then to top it off there was no coffee made so i had to wait an additional 7 minutes i am never going back to this mcdonalds ever 
visited for take out dinner recently inside the restaurant it was very clean all staff and patrons were masked and observing social distancing all staff had gloves felt very safe eating food from here we had a chili verde pork burrito garden burrito kids' cheese quesadilla guacamole and chips and classic margaritas everything was delicious my burrito was so substantial that i saved half for breakfast the next day good value quality food excellent service please support your local small businesses when you can 
i love everything about this place minus the fact that it's not next door to my apartment great customer service delicious food serves breakfast all day seriously is this place perfect i had the spicy fried chicken benedict it was amazing although i did need a nap immediately afterward i sat at the bar and i have to say that everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious also had a very personable waiter who gave recommendations told me about the history of the restaurant and was attentive during my meal excited to visit again and try something new 
visiting for the holidays after checking into our hotel we were starved asked concierge for a few recommendations this is the one we chose our welcoming was warm service terrific the menu item presentation taste were delicious if ever your in town or life in tucson give this restaurant a try i'll guarantee you you'll not be disappointed a solid 5 stars 
thee best spot in philly for hot pot i've gone several times since it's opened and never have i had a bad experience super delicious food and it's always fresh they even have a conveyor full of different things you can add if you're not fully satisfied mon-thurs bogo for those conveyor sides too can't beat that our server dave v was super knowledgeable and was very patient and funny highly recommend 
smoothies yes the juices are great but i'm so glad i discovered the strawberry smoothie it had strawberries banana yogurt and cold-pressed apple simple and delicious can't wait to try a bowl too 
first time to charley's and have to say we were rather disappointed we showed up a tad early for our reservation and were seated promptly at our reservation time it took awhile for the waiter to take our drink order despite having visited the table 3 times and after bringing water we knew we were in for a slow meal so we didn't order appetizers it didn't matter because it took forever regardless none of us were drinking wine but the server left the wine glasses in the table despite our asking fir them to be removed they sat there in our way until dinner was served after ordering our meal we expected salads and bread but they did not come for some time so we sat there forever with nothing i know some of this is nit-picky but when spending top dollar for your meal you expect impeccable and flawless service i had ordered the 21 day aged 22 oz prime bone in strip and was very excited to dive in when the meal finally arrived but was so disappointed what was supposed to be a fantastic cut of meat was overcooked and tough i ordered medium rare and the steak was well done on the edge and barely mid rare right next to the bone i didn't bother sending it back because 1 my server did not bother to ask if everything was cooked properly 2 it took so long to get it i was starving and 3 the last thing i want is the fake apologies of some apathetic manager whose sole job is to go around apologizing for poorly cooked meals when paying this kind of money i expect perfection right out of the gate to expect otherwise is to go to outback which is where i should have gone in the first place because this steak was subpar at best i cannot say i will return any time soon 
delicious they're so nice in there too great outside sitting area affordable and local
new and hot crabs are superr fresh kind of waste to order fried five stars for sure
st louis can be a tricky city when it comes to trending the city seemed to be ahead of the curve with craft cocktails and fried chicken seemed to land the area the middle of the bell curve the verdict is still out as to where the stl resides with ramen but for now robata seems to be making up for the past mistakes this city has made making this soup not that what saint louis has put out prior to this isn't good it just hasn't really been ramen in the more traditional sense of city ramen-ya's you can find in cities with concentrated japanese populaces prior presentations have been at best really good asian inspired soups but not really ramen per se it's all about the stock and the noodles and even the noodles are negotiable since pretty much every one of my favorite ramen restaurants outsource their noodles so i'm happy to say that robata does their tonkatsu stock quite well their slow cooked pork bone broth has the familiar unctuousness that can only be found from collagens and marrows breaking down over an extended period of time yielding a rich thick deceivingly creamy soup that clings perfectly to whatever style of noodle their customer wants thrown into their soup and may i also add that they seem to be all about adding a metric ton of noodles to their soup kaedama asking for a 2nd portion of noodles seems somewhat unnecessary as there's more than enough noodly goodness in their ramen to assure you'll be fueled up for a good 10 mile run the next morning their toppings encompass a pretty wide range of what is being offered in other ramen-ya's be it corn or spinach or more regionalized tastes like mustard green or ground pork while the core familiars of a ramen like soft boiled egg or pork belly are executed quite well with only a slight critique of the pork being a bit more sweet chinese bbq style than what i would have expected in my soup i do miss however their lack of offerings like naruto spiral fish cake seaweed sheets or snow grated lard but these aren't really deal breakers to the work they are currently doing what attracts me most to this place is how this restaurant does a great job of offering something else that is japanese to an area that has remained cemented in assigning japanese cuisine to only teppanyaki grills and sushi bars i can think of a myriad of different places in the area to get sushi some of them are pretty decent in fact but despite where this trend lies currently for stl i'm happy to see there's a shop out there that's doing things differently by offering a quality bowl of ramen at a decent price 
i would have given this a higher star review in the past however their ridiculous seating policy has now made it official that i will no longer be a patron first i came on a thursday evening months ago and there were many tables open my cousin hit traffic from the city and they would not allow me to sit until she arrived ridiculous i understand if it is busy but it was not tonight my friend is having a birthday dinner and we live five minutes away i am past my due date but feel great my honest friend told them this while making the reservations and she was told if my husband and i did not attend the party would not be seated now i will be sitting at home instead of being able to celebrate with my friends and my friends feel awful they wanted to cancel their reservations but i insisted on not doing that for me thanks terrain for not having empathy or understanding when your customers are honest with you
when charles ranhofer invented the eggs benedict in lower manhattan circa 1860 i am quite sure he never foresaw his concoction to be topped by the chefs at samaria cafe with notes of champagne in their delectable hollandaise the eggs benny as i affectionally call it- is my favorite breakfast in all of tampa bay which sadly brings me to the next portion of my critique amending my previous 5 star rating down to a 4 star review upon entering the restaurant this morning prior to my radio show my brother niles and i were greeted by a horrific smell the pungent aroma of a soiled aged mop long forgotten in the utility closet permeated not only our noses- but our souls well frasier i don't recall the yankee candle having a sale on exit 301 homosassa springs rest stop public restroom wax melts my brother whispered to me in jest the hollandaise sauce which we dreamt about the night prior was masked in the nightmare that was the smell of a mop that wiped every single restroom across america thanks for listening 
i attended horizons as a 2017 summer fellow tuition and housing covered i had a very positive experience--here's some things that stood out relentless focus on practicality horizon's syllabus is packed with topics directly relevant for developing modern mobile and web apps little to no time is spent on more theoretical cs concepts the result is that you can start making tangible projects really quickly for example many of our early projects were implementing imitations of popular web apps twitter clone for learning html css using twilio for learning api calls mock facebook chatroom for implementing servers to name a few choice of tracks in my year horizons offered 3 tracks in the latter half of the program allowing us to curtail the program towards our specific goals you could complete some guided week-long projects most popular prepare for job interviews primarily recent grads or work full-time on your project with a team community i felt a really strong sense of community at horizons within the first week of the program part of it is the fact that most horizonites are college students or recent grads this helps you bond with other students because you're all looking to learn about tech and potentially start tech-related careers at the same time i found horizonites highly energetic collaborative and innovative--i always looked forward to spending time with and learning from my fellow students i'm guessing most other students felt the same way just read the rest of the overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site i'm not aware of any other bootcamps that are similarly focused on college-aged students exposure to silicon valley culture horizons gives you a sense of life in silicon valley and the broader tech industry besides being situated in san francisco blocks away from such impactful tech companies as uber and twitter you also learn from regular speakers working in tech i learned so much from these speakers not only about careers paths in tech but about different ideas for improving lives through technology last year we had venture capitalists product managers founders and ceos and software engineers with several high-profile speakers including keith rabois cyan banister and balaji srinivasan availability of teachers and founders i generally found the founders abhi and darwish as well as the head teachers moose and ricky extremely supportive and accessible i never hesitated to ask for coding help or career advice from these knowledgeable individuals after the program i frequently went to sunny and darwish for advice about the recruiting process and they were extremely helpful in the process of securing a tech internship for the next summer it's really fun horzions is just objectively a fun way to spend a summer you're spending all day coding and building with 100 different diverse energetic college students and outside of coding you have the entire city of san francisco to explore with your fellow horizonites horizons was one of the best summers i've had so far i would recommend it enthusiastically to any college student looking to learn about tech and start building things quickly 
went in looking for a little nick nacks for the office and came out with a gold mind 
this was my first time actually being able to try the food i tried going 2 previous times but both times there was an issue where the restaurant had to close early i was skeptical about it because of the reviews that i read but this was the spot chosen for a birthday brunch the customer service could have been better it wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either the cashier server with the long braids was very nice and friendly but the other one with the curly hair had a very plain demeanor she wasn't rude but she didn't have any enthusiasm to herself the biker shorts she wore were see through and i personally don't think they were appropriate but besides that i ordered the 15 deal that included a small order of shrimp grits with an order of chicken waffles the waffles were very soft the chicken could have used a little more seasoning and i noticed that the chicken is not the same size for everyone i got 3 small strips where as someone i was with had 3 huge strips now as far as the shrimp grits they were amazing the grits were creamy and cheesy the shrimp was well seasoned and the sauce that came on top of it was great too i would definitely go back for that alone and order a large i also am not a fan of lobster but a friend ordered the fried lobster and waffles and i got to taste a bite of it and the lobster was great the seasonings and the flavor made me completely want to give lobster a chance again and i would definitely recommend this from main course and return for those items again 
might be okay if you're on foot and not in a hurry if you're driving there's no parking nearby not even pay parking service was really slow and staff avoided eye contact i didn't order coffee but the baked goods were standard noisy atmosphere i guess there was nothing special about this coffee shop that would cause me to seek it out again 
i wish i could say this place was better but the cleanliness has really gone downhill in the men's room sometimes i have to check four different soap dispensers in order just to get a little squirt of soap how hard is it to refill the soap dispensers and that should be a top priority for the men's room so it cost like absolutely nothing but yet you can't refill your soap dispensers this gym is getting very dirty the gym has no hand sanitizer really throughout the gym or water spray bottles to disinfect equipment or anything this place needs to be either taken over by a different management or by a whole other gym altogether this place has gotten so bad that i have paid for gym membership at a different location and i'm no longer going to this one even though it's walking distance from my house the place is so disgusting so stinky so gross a smelly i don't want to touch anything when i'm in there i literally smelled like rotten dirty cheese whenever i touch anything there with that being said i'm not going there even though i paid for my membership in full rejoined it's cleaner now
a hole in the wall well worth visiting low on ambience high on food and service april is very friendly and efficient costs were reasonable and you get a lot for what you order food was tasty and the restaurant was full with locals definitely a place to stop by for a good dinner 
we just closed on friday and kelly and her crew were amazing from kelly to chelsea to shiela to girls at the front they were all so helpful and guided us through the process step by step they were easy to get in touch with they explained everything and answered the hundreds of questions we had everyone we came in contact with were professional and so friendly this wasn't the first time buying a house and wow what a difference they made would absolutely use them or recommend them to anyone thanks to all of you for everything 
we saw a concert here last week and it was very intimate and the staff did a good job at getting everyone to their seats the bar they had set up on each side were efficient and poured a good drink the middle register stand had snacks just like at the theatre too once the concert started you could actually see the artist play and the sound lighting system was great they kept it very clean in there my so is very tall and the chairs didn't bother him too much either first time at this charming venue and definitely not the last 
i was totally ready to love saba tonight and it was almost great i feel like other reviewers have discussed the restaurant's many fine attributes so i'll focus on its easily-corrected shortcomings in case they're important to potential diners or enough others feel similarly that management makes adjustments the majority of the dishes were on par with my experience at shaya i e amazing but there were two glaring issues 1 the caviar service was 60 for trout eggs which is fine but for that price serving it with bags of zapp's potato chips and insufficient garnishes is just not acceptable creme fraiche chopped boiled eggs and chives are neither expensive nor hard to procure i like caviar and know it's expensive i have never complained about another restaurant's caviar prices it'd help to write zapp's on the menu instead of potato chips which many would take to mean house-made at that price point i like zapp's with a 10 sandwich but it's bizarre to be served bagged potato chips with essentially a 60 appetizer places that make their own potato chips to serve with caviar also make them a better caviar vessel shape than zapp's saba needs to level up or just not serve caviar 2 maybe this is just my pet peeve but the water glasses are tiny maybe 6 ounces with no bottle of water for the table i get the aesthetic appeal but that shouldn't require sacrificing hospitality i hate feeling like i have to ration my water and the staff was not especially speedy about refills - and sometimes they didn't even fill the glasses very full in their defense how can you be fast enough when diners have such tiny glasses this left me with a little indigestion and disinclined to return without a big bottle of water of my own which i briefly contemplated stepping out to buy from whole foods overall i might go back but 100 will not get the caviar and will bring a big bottle of water 
i am a crunch member from san diego visited this gym earlier am on 6 20 nice layout people were nice locker room pretty worn out free weight area nice with old style real metal plates needed to work on calves but nothing really available 
delicious food i ordered the lingua tacos which is tongue and it made me feel so delicious inside because i thought like i was a cow eating grass but the tongue meet was so tender and delicious and the salsa was even better complementary salsa and chips with your order 
food is amazing service not as much took some of my party 15 minutes to get our initial drinks and around the same just to get a refill the waitress got all 6 of our meals mixed up and it probably didn't help that she barely spoke english might give it one more try but for it being my first time i was not satisfied 
we had lunch at the nashville location and it was a very unique experience our kids loved the mermaid show and the ocean theme the food was great and the service was friendly 
this is my wife and i's anniversary birthday date place i remember the first time we went in my son was like 4 months old but we needed a nice date even if we had to take the kid chris saw that baby and scooped him up i figured she would bring him back after a few minutes but she trooped around with my son the whole dinner showing him to other frequent guests like it was her own it felt like we went to aunt chris's for dinner she treats you like she has known you forever we loved it and have never had an experience like this place every time we always enjoy the home like atmosphere of basque restaurants all over but this one is in a league of its own in every way 
when i think of bars i can't help but think of loud music and obnoxious people why can't there be a bar that's chill with space to move music that's fun and not too loud so you can actually have a conversation oh wait that's the bulldog mid city i completely enjoyed the outdoor patio even in the drizzling rain gabe and i went here after our dinner at luke at his suggestion he was a regular here awhile back and always talked about how i might like it i loved it great old school music and such a variety too the crowd was in the 30-something range late 30's and older maybe what i usually hate about bars is how cramped and stuffy they can be the outdoor patio gives us claustrophobs a place to not freak out while looking for a stool near the exit the canopy of trees with lanterns and string of lights are a nice touch definitely look forward to going back i couldn't think of a reason not to give it 5 stars great music beer atmosphere and company 
my favorite place to get a salad in indianapolis outstanding customer service i am a regular here 
ranoush definitely surprised me when i first stepped in i was expecting mediocre food and rushed rude service what i got instead was phenomenal food outstanding service and a great overall experience i highly recommend the chicken shwarma - it's served on pita bread with a side salad i always find it hilarious how excited i get over the salad i'm not sure what makes their salads so different but it's not your average kind - it's simply bursting with flavor also i really really recommend the vegetarian food here normally whenever i want to order something vegetarian a lot of restaurants bring out mushy steamed vegetables with absolutely no flavor but ranoush really shines here - i can't believe i'm saying this but for a carnivore i almost always prefer the vegetarian plates more than the ones with meat on them another thing i would recommend trying here are the kahwah arabic coffee it has the strength of espresso but still has a few of the grounds left in it if you're feeling adventurous go for the rose water or cardamom flavors of the drink the rose water kahwah smells like heaven and the cardamom gives coffee an interesting dimension it's seems so contradictory you really have to try it - the cardamom brings out the natural sweetness of the coffee and really brightens it up while giving it a little exotic flavor things to check out here lunch specials all weekdays belly dancing - friday and saturday evenings
very disappointing experience pho broth was tasteless meatballs in the soup was disgusting the only good thing about that place was the service staff 
highest possible recommendation for this amazing company we live in pa and purchased large heavy easily-damaged audiophile speakers though ebay contacted c f on the recommendation of our most brilliant friend they quickly replied with their quote then called jamie and i could immediately sense that this is a special and caring person later received communication from the equally-caring sandi that the speakers were in their warehouse and that they would inform us as to when the units would be shipped both jamie sandi kept us informed every step of the way the truck delivered them a couple of days ago and i have to say i've never seen a more careful packaging job in my life even down to the neatly applied labels and stenciled fragile applications this was packed to the level of art i should have photographed the work it was that nice so opened everything up and there was zero damage of any kind and i am one heck of an eagle eye - as i commented to jamie somebody pinch me please as needed to make certain that this level of caring isn't just a dream i honestly feel that c f indianapolis is at the top of their game thank you jamie sandi and the amazing packaging crew 
try to stop by here everytime i'm at the factory great vibe good coffee i love that they roast their own coffee on the premises a little pricey but with it 
came here and order the salmon with baked potato salmon was boring and baked potato was way over cooked they also charged me for a wine that was 6 more per glass than what i ordered it was late and i didn't find the waitress after i paid my bill without noticing the error pretty bad 40 dinner 
really like this place been in twice now once to replace a headlamp bulb the other engine and oil filters and and wiper blades courteous service place is nice and clean prices are competitive as well they followed up with me a few days later to see how my experience was for basic car type service they offer i would definitely recommend them 
this is a beautiful beach but it was way too crowded even on a thursday the beach is ranked among the best in the country so crowding is to be expected the boardwalk was too packed with vendors and music was blaring altogether it felt as though we were in an '80s movie about rival surf gangs parking is a joke the little parking lot at pier 60 is almost insulting you can do valet parking at the sandpearl resort and the parking is free if you eat at the resort's restaurant i was able to find street parking on a side street up from the resort i had to pay to park on the street but there's a mobile app you can download in order to refill the meter via your phone the signs are easy to follow side note the mobile-parking company has a contract to possibly do the same thing with nyc parking about freakin' time this is a lovely beach and i would definitely go again my review is more a 3 5 than a 3 
bad service went there seeing so many positive reviews had to wait 30 mins before someone even came over to our table to take drinks order apparently the lady attending that part of the restaurant didn't want to acknowledge our presence she totally ignored us and served the tables adjacent to us when finally we were able to order they messed up our order and brought only part of the order we had to wait another 45 mins for them to get us the rest of our food overall spent about 2 5 hrs there to get our food never going back 
wow told this place was a tourist trap if it was it's because it was amazing and deserves every tourist to come try it they wont be disappointed super calm and quite vibe as we were there weekday middle of the day had the bean and salsa scramble so flavorful and the potatoes seasoned to match desert was the king smoothie a bit heavy if you don't like chai but great to me go enjoy 
so i came here because it was on a list of places to go for gumbo but what really blew me away here was the service the woman who was serving us was phenomenal to the recommendation to the patience and going the extra mile and taking our photo for us at first i was confused coming in because this place is on bourbon st but does not fit sooo much more classier and they take their time giving you the menu after sitting you to take in the atmosphere the food although i couldn't eat much at the time is really good the gumbo was not bad pretty small for 8 but what really blew us away was the crab and the fish my sister really loved her speckled trout with almonds and my crab was very tasty not fishy overall we really had a good time here although it was on the pricier side - spent a little under 100 for the both of us two entrees one appetizer and one drink but the service was well worth it 
update i find some businesses if you give them constructive criticism they feel you're trying to destroy their business is it too much to ask that they give a quality pedicure and manicure in a quiet setting any complaints were taken as a deep insult every thing i said is a fact 
i had been here before and liked the food so when i saw a groupon for it i figured i'd buy it my boyfriend and i both had a bunch of work to do tonight so we decided that instead of spending the time to go out to dinner we would order takeout i ordered the food went to pick it up after 30 minutes because they said that's how long it would take and i proceeded to show them my groupon i was then told that the groupon wasn't good towards takeout -- i had read the fine print before ordering and nowhere in there is that stated i told them that i had read the terms on the groupon and it didn't say anywhere that it couldn't be used for takeout and i just got a yeah i'm sorry about that you're actually the second person today to try to use that for takeout --- well yeah probably because it doesn't say anywhere on there that it's not okay besides that the food took about 15-20 minutes longer than they said it would if you're going to have restrictions on your deals make sure that it's listed in the fine print since ya know that's what the fine print is for 
this review is to say thank you to the service department mary-hellen and the whole crew my sister and mom were on their way to new york to pick up my daughter from camp when my forester started having issues with the hill assist sensor which was replaced under a recall a couple of months ago the car was stopping on its own even with the gas being given quite dangerous at highway speeds this service department was the closest and after explaining that they had to get to new york by certain time the staff took the car in made the adjustments and had my family back on the road in record time thank you for your kindness and professionalism in my book you are the best 
the place looks nice and clean we ordered the hot salsa and chips and the salsa definitely had some spice but was lacking in flavor i was really looking for something that had a really good kick and great flavor as well my burrito which had carnitas as my filling was ok and size is ok nothing spectacular but maybe could have used some sauces to really assist with the flavors my wife got the shrimp bowl which she only was a fan of the shrimp itself overall i would say this place is average if your feeling tacos with not a long wait and decent flavors then this could work but wouldn't be anything to spread the word and brag about 
will never return to hearth of oak pub the food was under seasoned and the chicken was chewy for the prices and we were also overcharged on each one of the items quite dissatisfied and disappointed on the foods and no i won't be returning nor bringing my family to this place 
great experience from start to finish dr rhode was very professional with excellent bedside manner and my tooth cleaning with jeanette was equally great would definitely recommend and look forward to my next visit 
love this little place staff are very sweet and food is fresh and delicious cant get enough of the warm rolls and garlic and herb olive oil my tummy is happy 
i got a giftcard for here from a work function so we stopped by for brunch a few weekends ago i haven't been for decades l so i wasn't really sure what to expect the food was average breakfast food but the service is what turned me off our waitress was rather abrupt and when she didn't bring the hashbrowns that were part of my meal i inquired and she promptly told me i was wrong and they weren't included i checked the menu after the fact and they were definitely part of the description a little added courtesy would have been appreciated oh well the husband enjoyed his french toast and it was a nostalgic experience it is worth noting that they do allow you to use giftcards towards gratuity which was a pleasant surprise as many restaurants do not regardless we probably won't be back unless i acquire another giftcard 
for some reason an order of sausage eggs is not on their all day breakfast menu i don't know exactly what that means since you can get eggs and sausage in the regular big breakfast or on an egg mcmuffin anyway i went ahead and ordered a salad since it was just 10 minutes into the lunch hour when i got home something seemed a bit off with it on further investigation it looked like somebody spit in my salad yuck 
we have been to crispy cajun twice now and both times our food was spot on i can only finish about a quarter to half of my meal which i take home for lunch the next day the serves is helpful and friendly we love when a small business gets things right and crispys knows their product large portions for what you pay for 
newtown book record exchange has a prime location on state street newtown right next door to starbucks if this isn't a gold mine just based on overflow from the s i don't know what is first impressions walking through the front door is one of narrow aisles and stacks of used books and cd's also some tapes etc with hand written labels to direct you and creaky wooden floors that have been tread on for more than a century yes there is also a dustiness and slight scent of decaying paper as would be expected where thousands of old books are stored it all adds to the overall gestalt of entering a literary and musical time warp it is quite enjoyable if you like this sort of thing i do likely due to the rent paid for this location the prices on the books and music are higher than seems reasonable and the trade in policy is not designed to provide value to the trader over the years i have purchased a few things here on impulse but overall aside from wanting the old place to survive the selection is generally not what i am looking for and the cost offsets the cultural and historic imperatives definitely worth a long browse while sipping caffeine from next door but if you have visited the princeton record exchange you know what a dedicated used music emporium is all about this one is not that as to the books you might find something you like but if you don't the newtown library company is about 2 blocks away you can join and likely find what you seek and be able to return it after reading recycling at its earliest and best 
excellent options for savory brunch unlike most brunch options in the french quarter cafe amelie offers a relaxed pace in a courtyard with lush greenery greenery should weather not permit the interior has a beautifully painted ceiling and antique decor service was friendly and did not feel rushed however we arrive at 2pm and they close at 3- it may be a stretch to find a table at peak hours cochon means pulled pork made from a pig that is still suckling so it is extra tender it was extra tender very savory blend of spices it's cooked with but not too overwhelming of the pork flavor i had the eggs over easy with with cochon it was served on a cheddar chive biscuit all topped with a very flavorful sausage gravy the sausage gravy and pork were both mildly spicy which was nice the biscuit was very tender and huge the eggs were cooked perfectly the cochon de lait is a sandwich of pulled pork on a fresh ciabatta with mayonnaise and pickles the sandwich was savory and a generous portion for brunch very moist and tender healthy serving of pulled pork however the sandwich was served alone- it would have been nice with a bowl of fresh fruit or something else to contrast the saltiness 
the vanilla bourbon ice cream was so good i just wish they had more options for kids my neice and son picked the chocolate ice cream because there wasn't much selection for younger kids cones are also really small might need to invest and larger cones returned this summer and we tried multiple flavors peach-root beer-coconut and cant remember the rest but my kids liked it
don't be fooled by the outside of this place it looks abandoned but once you head inside you are pleasantly surprised by how nice it is like a secret hidden gem i tried four different vegetarian dishes and they were all really good maybe i've lived here too long but i think that this place is really good not just good for edmonton i can't wait to go back 
garbage straight garbage reserved a car weeks in advance through the budget app had a choice to pre-pay or pay 12 increase the day of my reservation i chose to get the better deal and pre-pay our plans changed so we no longer needed the car we'll come to find out since i pre-paid i will incur a 50 charge for canceling my reservation my rental was 62 for the weekend so i asked if i could modify the reservation instead but was told that would also incur a penalty and there could be a change in rate customer service said they've heard a lot of complaints about his but could not doing anything about it that's the last and only time i rent from them 
this is my second time having five guys one of my family members hasn't tried it yet so we decided to come here i had the mini hamburger with everything mayo lettuce pickles tomatoes grilled onions grilled mushrooms ketchup and mustard the burger is a pretty good size even for a mini i also had the cajun fries i ordered the regular size and they put a lot they put the fries in a cup and so when they give you your food they put it all in a bag but when they put the fries in the bag i saw them get another scoop of fries and pour it into the bag which came out to be about 3 cups of fries instead of 1 which is awesome we weren't able to finish it so we took it home you can also eat some of the peanuts that they have while waiting for your food or take some to go the service is fine same as any other fast food note you can also add jalapeno peppers green peppers a1 steak sauce bbq sauce and hot sauce but everything is the ones listed above 
i love h m i really like that this store has kids clothing as the ones in seattle do not the only complaint i have is that i feel this one lacks in the style and amount of clothing that the stores in the seattle area seem to have i still really liked how clean this store was and how talkative friendly the store employees were all of them seemed very excited happy to be there i think it is a nice touch to the boise town square as most of the store there aren't ones i would shop at when i visit yay boise for getting an h m 
go for the ambiance not the food seemed like just another trendy restaurant which made it exactly what it aspires not to be expensive boring and uninspired skip it 
dinner time as we drove from huntington beach to cambria trusty yelper had great thing to say about los agaves so we stopped for dinner fun spot for a casual dinner you stand in line to order the line moves very quickly so don't let the line discourage you as it was our first time there many helpful suggestions from other in line who had been there before we went with the shrimp and fresh fish enchiladas and a carnitas burrito given how busy they were i was a bit nervous about finding a table but a server pointed us to the back and an open table when you go be sure to make several trips to the fresh salsa bar the burrito was good but the enchiladas delectable fresh ingredients seasoned just right highly recommend 
the staff here is incredible the venue is intimate and accommodating to say the least thank you nikki and alex and andy sr i highly recommend this venue for both the entertainment and a most helpful staff this venue is awesome thank you nikki alex and andy 
my new favorite spot for center city happy hour this place has ample drink choices all cleverly named after celebrities try the amy winehouse champagne raspberry liquor sugared rim if you like a sweet girly drink you won't be disappointed the bar also as 3 apps try the edamame- it's a steal for 3 also had a flat bread pizza not on happy hour menu which was pretty good all in all good drinks good price good atmosphere thanks alfa 
try the queso-rito quesadilla wrapped burrito style the flavor is phenomenal after the tortilla gets the quesadilla treatment try that and you'll be saying byebye to nachos plain old burritos 
the food was good the service was good and the drinks were good we got oysters mussels crawfish fritters lobster rolls and salmon the worse part of the meal was the french fries that came with mussels so under seasoned they desperately needed salt and a dipping sauce will definitely go back but i won't get fries again 
a group of six of us went here when it was a really busy night we waited for about 10 minutes and the owner came to us and give us all a free dinner for our wait the food was absolutely amazing and the pasta was perfect 
even though the name is cheesey i had the best experience here after searching 4 or 5 other stores for a comfy chair i bought a great one at cc the store is clean and well-maintained the lady i dealt with on both visits was very friendly and helpful the day i came in to buy the chair it turned out they were having a holiday sale i ended up getting a fantastic cushy chair in great shape for 150 
fast and good hot wok is a nice place to get a good business lunch i've only ever had lunch there on the fly and on the cheap the service is fast and friendly the atmosphere is clean and pleasant you have to ask for chopsticks but apart from that it's just what you'd want in a good chinese restaurant 
very disappointing over sauced tasteless pastries massive amounts of whipped cream this is the huge portion of low quality food model compares very poorly to everywhere else we ate in sb wish i had paid the bill and not eaten anything oh by the way it's not cheap either 
i took my friend here this morning because she wanted to get breakfast for herself i don't know how people are eating here the odor was disgusting it smelt like something died and i was just purely disgusted my friend ate her food and said it was good so if you can get past the smell go for it i wouldn't recommend though
to be honest the only thing about this location is that i almost pass it every time i want to go there its a great place every is always super friendly and seems to be in a good mood my wife and i can both eat for under 15 bucks i am a burger and fries kind of guy my wife being from africa has to have taste and flavors she loves the hot dog with tons of stuff on it you get to eat as many peanuts as you can while you are waiting on your food i have never had to wait a long time as long as you don't go at lunch time the place is very clean it is nice they keep enough people working so someone can clean up the dinning area i have ate every kind of burger you can get there while my wife has had the hot dog with every different topping they offer we always get the cajun fries because they are the best and they always put tons in the bag 
went in looking for furniture after trying some other stores in town and found they had the best prices we had stephen as our salesperson and he wasn't the least bit pushy like other stores can be he popped up here and there as we browsed around but never overstayed while we discussed which furniture we wanted while their website said free delivery what they don't tell you is that you cannot finance it through them and get free delivery at the same time the delivery fee is a bit on the higher end but the tradeoff between 4 years interest free financing wasn't worth it in my opinion we still found they had what we liked at the price we were willing to pay so we were overall happy delivery for the majority of our purchase is scheduled for this coming weekend one item was backordered so this review may be updated in the future 
i love taking my 3 year old daughter to playgrounds of tampa we go at least once a week and it is so clean and we'll attended by the staff much nicer than other similar places we've been to my daughter always has a blast and they are very good about monitoring the number of kids who are in the play area at one time my daughter is tiny and i always feel safe with her playing here without having to hover over her love this place 
the tuna tartar is really amazing fre h great addition to magazine st quality wine list wonderful restaurant for a romantic dinner as well as local hangout 
i had the misfortune of living in st louis mo i lived in an area near the down town area right in between soulard and lafayette square there was no name to the neighborhood at the time but realtors made one up called mc kinley heights i guess it is named after the high school in the area i remember laying under the bed so bullets could fly through the window for the past 30 years st louis always ties with detroit for the number one city in the country for violent crimes for tourists wanting to visit it is not called saint louee it is st louis and it is mad dangerous it was so bad that the bus driver instead of dropping me off on the corner like his route said to he would drop me off in front of where i was living my advice to tourists stay in at night http homes yahoo com news most-dangerous-cities-in-america html there are so many links i could give just look at any statistic http blogs riverfronttimes com dailyrft crime shootings_stabbings_thieving_a while st louis is usually number one or two for crime nyc is number 250 for violent crime st louis is so bad that residents who were born there call it st louis misery most of the history of st louis was from the world's fair ice cream was invented there http inventors about com od foodrelatedinventions a ice_cream_cone htm the worlds fair was in 1904 here is a link to st louis foods http stlplaces com stl_foods st louis has it's own style of pizza and locals love it but i hate it i hardly ever went out and risked my life by eating out in st louis but you learn the most about how people eat by eating in their homes block party's bbq's and cook outs the only really good food memory i have is bbq they all know how to bbq well block party's cook outs eating at home i have had some of the best bbq of my life there but that's about it i have life long friends from st louis but most of them either left or want to leave like all cities with crime and poverty they have a great arts scene http artsamerica org st-louis but over all a depressing city anton levay choose st louis to be his home http www riverfronttimes com 2000-12-20 news the-source-of-evil this is taken from strange facts about st louis http www strangecosmos com content item 157660 html the soft drink dr pepper was introduced at the 1904 world's fair in st louis 7-up also was invented in st louis d st louis was the site of the demonic possession treated by a jesuit priest from st louis university theological that inspired the book and later the movie the exorcist e the ice cream cone was invented at the 1904 world's fair so was iced tea hot dogs and hamburgers were popularized to a wide audience at the fair f st louis was once the largest shoe-manufacturing center in the world -- home of buster brown and other famous brands g the largest collection of mosaic art in the world graces the walls and ceilings at the cathedral basilica of saint louis in the central west end neighborhood h st louis is home to the oldest institution of higher learning west of the mississippi river - saint louis university i hawken rifles and murphy wagons used by the western pioneers were made in st louis j the cocktails planter's punch martini bloody mary and tom collins were invented at a st louis hotel the planter's house k the custom of placing chocolates on hotel pillows begins here when the actor cary grant stayed at the mayfair and used chocolate to woo a woman friend the people are good people but imo the city in general tends to be backwards and dangerous the first jewish congregation west of the mississippi was founded here as was the first library west of the mississippi m famous writers including t s eliot maya angelou william gass tennessee williams eugene field and many others were from st louis n the missouri botanical garden is among the top three botanical gardens in the world o the first ironclad boat was built by james buchanan eads in the port of st louis eads also invented the diving bell to salvage steamboat wrecks from the mississippi river and built the first bridge using steel truss construction - the 1874 eads bridge p st louis offers more free major visitor attractions than anyplace outside of the nation's capital including the saint louis art museum saint louis zoo cahokia mounds museum of westward expansion st louis science center missouri history museum anheuser- busch brewery grant's farm and more q the first kindergarten in the u s was founded in st louis by susan blow r peanut butter was invented here during a visit from george carver s famous musicians including chuck berry tina turner miles davis albert king david sanborn michael mcdonald the doobie brothers were from st louis missouri native sheryl crowe taught school in st louis t st louis was the first american city to host the olympic games 1904 more as yelp allows
1st time customer super-friendly staff enormous portions fresh fresh fresh of course good wine incredible pesto too much food what's not to like so happy you are in my neighborhood you made a fan 
front desk messes up a lot they rescheduled me for a different time and different therapist and didn't let me know no appointment reminders they rescheduled me with someone who could not do deep tissue like i wanted- it was the absolute worst massage i've ever had i canceled my membership immediately and the front desk didn't cancel my account correctly so i still got charged--good thing i checked my statement waiting to hear from the owners 
if you are looking for a beach with a lot of things to do then clearwater beach is the place to go in tampa bay there are a lot of restaurants hotels shops and activities they have a lot of dinner cruise ships and jet skiing etc the scenery is beautiful crossing the bridge to clearwater beach and i just walking around the area it can get pretty crowded and there are lots of families with kids if you are looking for a beach with lesser people around to just relax clearwater beach isn't one of them 
consistently delicious and affordable thai food super nice people running this place who make the experience even better 
500 for an oil change my mistake was not asking more questions and he took full advantage of that really seemed like an honest guy boy i was wrong 
i recommend the grenade on the rock so did the bartender i tried both versions but the frozen grenade was a lot sweeter for some reason and it was a lot more pleasant to drink it on the rock i normally don't like overly sweet drinks but i enjoyed it a lot 
y'all this place made me so happy i cannot think of the last time i ordered a steak that needed no additional seasoning it was cooked perfectly and so flavorful we came after a very stressful day of being at two hospitals for my mom we were exhausted and just wanted to be taken care of checking in here on yelp scored me a free glass of red wine much appreciated and it was delicious the people that work here really know their stuff and really care about their customers everything we had was amazing and the staff was making great recommendations for us nothing disappointed we will be back 
i have been professionally moved many times this was by far the best experience armstrong managed and moved me from socal to nashville they showed up on time for the estimate packing and for loading the truck it was a complicated move i had stuff in los angeles and also 100 miles away in temecula they had to load the stuff from both locations on very specific dates that i specified they met those dates the moving team was very professional friendly attentive considerate accommodating and efficient i was very impressed armstrong also had to manage special services for items such as a pool table large safe large screen tv transport of some vehicles from los angeles and other vehicles from temecula all of those services were performed on time and to my expectations they also made a point of delivering everything in nashville by my preferred date the good services did not stop they helped setup furniture and sort boxes in various rooms per my requests they followed-up later to check on my move-in and also came back to pickup the empty boxes i hope to not move again for a few years but if i do i will contact armstrong i was fortunate to experience an a team 
i like this place a lot it's open 24 hours a day 7 seven days a week the staff is great they have a nice selection of free weights and different machines they could use more treadmills they have about 7 but there are usually a couple that aren't been used so you don't have to wait i love that the place is christian owned so they play praise music while you work out there is a small side fitness room where you can warm up etc i wish that room was bigger because it's usually crowded i pay 28 month which is better than la fitness and some other gyms but i wish the price was closer to planet fitness's price of 10 month 
oh i don't know the fried duck wings were amazing but nothing else was in the same category everything else was good don't get me wrong but didn't really live up to expectations my burger was undercooked my husbands was over-cooked averaging the two would've gotten to the medium we both ordered fries were good but not necessarily special service was good every table has a tv with adjustable volume good or bad depending on your interpretation beer selection was excellent so there's some redemption there are there better burger places in town not sure am i being overly critical because we've been eating out for every meal in our week long vacation perhaps just not a 5-star meal though 
food excellent a little pricey brussels sprouts were some of the best i've had but i think they were 15 yikes ribs pretty yummy french fries had a nice flavoring to them and my kids gobbled them chicken bai nothing like cha shu bao but tasted like a bahn mi but good fried rice was pretty good seating comfy we made a reservation and we were almost first customers and hostess tried to seat us on patio and it was freezing with our 5 and 6 year old i thought that was a little lame service excellent 
this museum may have smaller footprint but it is packed with fun exhibits and displays as a biologist i really enjoyed the eclectic mix of live exhibits their gorgeous specimen collection and hands on activities such as petting a millepede and strolling through the butterfly house the very friendly knowledgable staff and relaxed atmosphere made this the perfect stop to begin my day of sight seeing 
okay let me start by saying i'm not a hyatt place fan why 1 the smell i know that they pipe in the chosen hyatt place smell in the lobby and hotel and it gives me a headache i often joke about it with the front desk staff they don't like it either 2 food there really is no restaurant the coolers by the front desk just contain a selection of salads sandwiches etc that have been sitting there all day i know there is a free breakfast which is cool but it's just a bunch of microwaved eggs bacon etc now the exception at this location there are not any outside food options so i went to the lobby for dinner looking at the salads in the cooler i was bummed but noooooooo my waitress made me a salad from scratch and it was awesome it was huge freshly made and loaded with fruits vegetables chicken and a nice dressing on the side well done hyatt place tucson 
i went during lunch and had the buffet tons of options and the food itself was delicious for the cost this place is a steal if you enjoy indian food then i highly recommend you check this place out you won't be disappointed 
best sushi is riverview area really nice variety of diff types of fish they also have a punch system that gives you free sushi 
first off i was charged members ship fees again and told i did t have to pay membership fees for the two of us who have already been there lie also we ended up on ground level and not one time in the two hours we were there did they clean off the balls on the front of where we stood there were so many balls on the course you literally couldn't hit a ball onto the free with out other balls stopping it we bought a lot of food it took a long time to come but was good i really don't like how the ticket however suggests i should pay gratuity on the member ship fees and booth rental since well they could even clear the course off it get the memberships correct the w was sticking so my email never was entered correct if i go back i'm definately not going to the ground level it literally should be cheaper then all the other levels the ground level served my worst experience at the faculty also it's 60 bucks person if you play and eat 
i've been excited to finally try this place since i like other restaurants in the group especially cali this place was a huge disappointment the food was disappointing service slow and it so dirty i was seated next to a tile wall that is installed horribly and had food gunk all over it pretty low standards 
scheduled a surprise salon visit for my wife this weekend they called me that day stating the stylish she was scheduled had called out and was looking to reschedule fortunately in the end the owner stepped up and took it upon himself to do her consultation and hair it came out fabulous could not be more pleased we look forward to our next visit 
i've been a patient of retief skin center for over a decade dr retief and dr missy are the best they've kept my skin safe clean and cancer free i love all of their staff my monthly facials with lauren are so wonderful my skin has never looked better and i feel and look amazing when i leave any injections i've had have been done with expertise and care i'm a bit of a scaredy-cat and they always make me comfortable and at ease check this place out it is the best dermatologist office in town 
based on the reviews i was expecting awesome sushi our server was knowledgeable and very attentive with a smile on her the entire time great service however the food was mediocre at best i ordered the 10 piece sushi and found the sushi to be room temperature and the roll was not fresh tasting the ginger salad was soaked in dressing and was hard to finish the misogyny soup was tasty but to starchy was not impressed at all 
as a new yorker finding bottomless mimosas for under 20 was a steal i came here for brunch as a group of 4 our server was very knowledgeable and even gave suggestions on what to explore while in new orleans the food was excellent and flavorful also upon finishing brunch our waitress asked if we would like to take a mimosa or glass of ros to go which definitely made the experience well worth it it is a few blocks from bourbon street so it is quieter and more intimate i'm sure it would make a great place for dinner as well definitely recommend making a trip to kingfish 
i arrived at 10p so that may be partial to blame but the food was absolutely dreadful sweet tea was watered down tasted awful and as if it had been sitting in watered down ice for a while the brisket lacked flavor tasted oily and as if it wasn't marinated at all it left a taste in your mouth as if you ate motor oil or gas - not a bit of bbq flavor or anything - so don't order this if you're think bbq it's bland no flavor no spice and tastes awful this is a place where it looks popular bc of the drinks flowing but if you go off the food and service we had - keep looking don't let these ratings fool you - it's terrible 
just as good if not better than the original east nashville location it has a lot more room we sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait and the bartender was awesome she made a point to get to know us let us sample a beer or two that was on draft so we could find a new beer my wife and i would like and was super attentive once we got our food i wish i could remember her name but anyways she was awesome 
i really like burger king's food and like to eat there often my problem is with the store manager his name is nestor he talks down to me every single time i come in the store i've just about had enough and i'm ready to stop coming in 
had dinner was excellent the mussels were so tasty and had to soak up every drop of sauce they were in 
correct me if i am wrong but an apartment complex where one lives tells the united stated mail service to deliver packages mailed to its residents to the office rather the place of residence without the permission or request of the resident and by further not contacting the resident when mail arrives does that not constitute interference with the delivery of u s mail by the united states postal service and is that not a felony punishable under the united states code governing delivery of the mail and is that not also an invasion of privacy of the residents that provides undo access to knowledge about its residents business dealings and by further attaching adverting materials to the same u s mail does that not constitute mail tampering and isn't that a felony under the law that id exactly what is happening at governor square these days and someone needs to be held accountable for these actions in fact i have it in good authority that this also happens at another property gramercy place formerly mohawk hills owned by the same huge corporation buckingham and associates which leads me to believe that this is actually a corporate decision 
we found this place through feast magazine they were voted best brunch and can see why our table had a little of everything and everything was delicious our waitress and hostess were fantastic 
the friendly staff was the highlight here the rooms are dated and tired looking my room was clean but everything is visibly worn the address here is the same as the hilton confusing any uber uber eats or lyft so factor that in despite adding direction notes it was a daily challenge getting my ride on time no food dinner options at the hotel the breakfast looks and feels like a free breakfast the hilton next door has a steakhouse i wouldn't recommend to anyone overall it was okay i'd definitely look into other options closer to downtown before staying here again this was booked on short notice for a work trip 
beautiful simply beautiful the decor is everything cute and quaint could def be used a dainty coffee shop in new york the desserts are delicious as well the staff is a friendly and the gelato is superb 
i've been going here for a long time and i must say the quality has not changed i love how intuitive they are from adding things too the menu and making there own sauces etc if your ever in town and looking for a warm welcome and hot cafe con leche give these guys a try 
great atmosphere whole place smelled of bbq awesome busy but easy to get a seat low and slow piggy mac was excellent perfect portion bbq platter all 3 meats for less than 15 brisket was excellent 
glad my favorite taco truck has there own restaurant now they have many options to choose from of course taco truck is limited but it's fresh taco could have been a little juicier the music could have been better lol a nice rotation would have been nice 
i was lucky enough to book a sunset dinner cruise for my family on easter sunday which also just happened to be my wife's birthday i made the correct choice by far captain mac and his wife kathy were so accommodating they were very interesting to talk to and our grand kids had a wonderful time our granddaughter got to steer the boat our grandson helped to hoist the main sail and jim and kathy couldn't have any more attentive to us at all the dinner was fantastic and between the snacks salad entree and dessert there was more food than we all could eat and they provided take home boxes for us the lionheart was a very sturdy solid boat which rode the waves smoothly and it had beautiful teak wood trim the view of downtown tampa was beautiful all lit up it's a shame i can only give 5 stars instead of the 10 10 it deserves i highly recommend olde world sailing line if you are looking for a wonderful change of pace for the family or an intimate evening with a loved one i have told some of my co-workers and extended family members about how wonderful it was and suggested that they try it when they come down to visit us richard tornes
a secret gem that we somehow just found omg i finally have a place to get an amazing antipasto salad plus the pizza is delicious 
slow night and bartenders 3 took way too long never ordered food as i figgured it would take 2 hours 
dr adam and the joint have been a lifesaver for me i signed up for 4 adjustments a month the cost is very affordable and the wait time is usually very minimal the hours are convenient as well love it here 
this is a great italian place good pasta and salad nice waiters waitresses good place to go if you're having a chill night and craving italian high on recommendations
very quiet but polite young lady working the stand the snowballs three of us all tasted watered down would not go back 
long line up the block took about 45 minutes to order then another 10-15 to get our beignets happy we came here alton brown said this was a best thing i ever ate in new orleans and it was far and away better than that other beignet chain they were light and fluffy everything i expect in a beignet 
it's a lovely space with lovely service but the food was not anything special the menu was nothing interesting particularly local or sustainable which at a restaurant at that level and price you expect something special we got the black sea bass with tomato sauce and broccoli which was nice but there were tons of bones in the fish which we weren't warned about and made it hard to eat also got a spicy tuna tar tar which was not spicy and just meh a sardines toast that was good but also meh the bread with seaweed butter was good not great just kinda hoped for more have eaten at the original and this is not nearly as good not terrible or anything but go to the other restaurant or any other place in town that serves the same fish at half the price 
my ac was not cooling and i had called the company that originally installed the unit and was mistakenly told the problem was with my nest thermostat i replaced the thermostat with a new nest but it still didn't cool i then tried to troubleshoot over the phone with nest support but did not get very far then i found richard the ac therapist through nest website as the closest nest pro to my location he answered my text immediately even though it was after 11pm and confirmed an appointment for the next day at which time he correctly diagnosed my ac problem and also reinstalled my old nest which still works fine he could have tried to sell me a whole new system since my system is over 10 years old but he was able to get it up and running again for the cost of a service call evidently not all ac contractors understand how nest works so if you have ac problems with nest installed you need to call a nest pro i e richard the ac therapist 
pretty dirty there was some indiscriminate red smudge on the back of my seat and there was lipstick on my coffee cup the food was pretty disgusting my mother got french toast with bananas but the banana slices were practically rotten i got an omelette with toast and it was one of the worst omelettes i've ever had the waiter forgot my toast at first and when he finally brought it it was burnt to a crisp i like toast to be a little overdone i didn't ask for it to be overdone though mind you but this was literally inedible i can't believe anyone in the right mind would serve food like that to top it all off the waiter although sweet was extremely forgetful and rarely came around although they were pretty packed at the time i will never for the life of me understand why never again will i return here it's quite literally the worst establishment i've ever eaten at 
this animal hospital is excellent i can't praise them enough our rottie suddenly got sick and quickly slid away it was a terrible loss for us and it was a terrible time for our family but the staff dr and a wonderful young lady named symphony was absolutely incredible the empathy compassion and professionalism is phenomenal these people truly care about their patients the families and their work and it shows this day was one of the most difficult times in our family and we were treated remarkably the staff was incredibly patient and understanding the dr was very informative and although had to break the bad news to us he did it in a compassion and considerate manner the facility services are comparable to a human hospital the fees are easy to understand and upfront no surprises but the staffs bedside manner is what really send this hospital over the top thank you to all from the front desk to the nurses to the drs and especially symphony thank you so very much i highly recommend this hospital for any all your veterinary needs 
these thieves kept my card subsequently ran it twice and claimed they didnt have it beware
my audi a4 had to go in for service and it turned out my radiator was leaking black stuff from the bottom and needed to be replaced i called the repair shop to ensure that they would honor my extended warranty and they seemed hesitant about it but then i told them it was from delta auto protect and their sentiments seemed to change quickly they raved about how they've dealt with that company before and never had an issue they told me to come in as soon as i could and they would take care of everything i did just that and communicated with a delta rep named kathy about what i was going to have done to my car she assured me that they have worked with this repair shop in the past and would coordinate everything long story short my car was repaired in just a few hours really great to hear that delta has a great reputation looking forward to continuing being a customer 
we came in late for some taco tuesday action the tacos were flavorful and authentic i really enjoyed the pastor tacos with pineapple jody even told us which of the salsas were spicy a nice touch if someone in your group is not a fan of the heat the parking was not an issue for us but seemed to be fairly limited if you choose to stop by during a busier time we will be stopping in again 
this place is a tourist sports bar for the convention center i went with a group of 7 we each had different items to eat prices are high better food for alot cheaper in the area i read the reviews and went the cheap route with the 8 burger burger was ok fries were cold i sent them back they came back hot n greasy the manager stop by and i showed her my fries and asked her if she eats the food here she said only the salads she took my burger off the bill and asked if i wanted something else i went with the gumbo when it came the rice was in a side dish i tasted the gumbo and it had a good flavor but only a small piece of chicken the size of a nickel the rest was juice i guess the cooks were not happy we sent food back this was our first and last time here not worth the money 
first time here and i really enjoyed it this is a great addition to the carmel scene we went on a friday and the wait was about 45 minutes a bit longer than we were told but not too bad i had the pork tenderloin and it was very good the service was a bit slow but we weren't in a hurry so we didn't mind there is some outside seating but it wasn't open yet due to the time of year this will be a nice place to sit outside and have a drink and maybe a stroll on the nearby monon trail afterwards or walk the shops will go back again 
this place is good for a sandwich or cheesesteak i enjoy their chicken cheesesteaks and their onion rings are delicious i definitely do not recommend getting delivery i only live 1 5 miles away and the food took an hour and a half to get to my house despite grub hub saying it would take 45 minutes from order time to delivery by the time i got it the food was cold and sandwiches were soggy makes me wonder what their delivery people are doing for so long however when i go and pick it up the food is hot and tastes great oh did i mention they have homemade root beer so good 
ultimate combon was great big oysters and peel n eat shrimp was delicious taking the whole family back soon 
called on a friday morning had 10 a cake ready for pickup by the next morning at the time i specified cake german chocolate was amazing delicious cake friendly staff can't ask for much else 
new store in wayne is awesome great selection friendly and informative staff 
i met a former co-worker for lunch at gc i did not realize what a large chain it is since the granite city name sounds pretty local i count them as being in 13 states while i prefer to eat at one-off places what we had was certainly fine they have a broader menu than i expected i guess what separates them from applebee's and chili's and friday's is that they offer their own beers they are regional and they are newer on the block i had a half sandwich and salad combo the dinner salad was nice and fresh with a lot more than just cow lettuce everything was crisp my sandwich was the overlake which had smoked turkey bacon tomato and lettuce with cheese i skipped the garlic aioli it was really fine this place is what it is a chain i am always amazed when another of this style restaurant opens i guess there is nothing new under the sun but i don't know how they distinguish themselves you could almost write their menu without going into the place granite city is fine for lunch like i had our service was very good by what appeared to be grade school girls funny how they keep getting younger it is not a place where i will spend my money or calories for dinner 
absolutely awful service had a 5 30 appt with them to get my nails done for a wedding i walk in and say hello and literally not one person in there turned to say hello back extremely rude staff i then told them i had a 5 30 appt again no response i wait 15 minutes and get up to leave then and only then does one of the nail techs even acknowledge my presence i ask how long the wait since it's already 15 past my appt time she asks me if i have an appt and i say yes she says oh ok 5 minutes so i wait 15 more minutes again everyone goes back to not even acknowledging my presence very very rude staff that apparently don't realize that you can walk 50 yards and hit another nail place i highly recommend you look elsewhere if you want decent customer service i will never being going back and i will spread the word of their awful attitudes 
we had a lovely lunch before biking the pinellas trail our waitress sunny was friendly informative and efficient our group enjoyed salads burgers and fish and chips no one was disappointed great place 
is it weird if i want to gush about an urgent care clinic i feel like it is - and yet living in the north valleys this is the default place we tend to head to if needing urgent care i've always had very good experiences here the office staff is professional and courteous and the medical staff is great while urgent care by nature tends to lead to a very crabby me in addition to feeling like garbage i've never had that experience at this location but my last experience really blew me out of the water and had me actually raving to people afterward about how fantastic it was it was a monday in the midst of a few really nasty bugs going around i arrived to find a packed waiting room so figured i was in for a long day as usual the woman who checked me in was great she did warn me before i'd even been seated at her desk that i was looking at about a 2hr wait to be seen by a doctor - something i heard her and the other gal working the desk give every person who came in a heads up about i t was great to find that renown has a public wifi network set up for patients to access between that and a seat near an outlet i was able to get some work done while waiting - helping the time pass more quickly and feeling a bit less stressed about all of the stuff piling up back at the office was really pretty awesome with so many things though it was the little things from this visit that had me leaving a bigger fan than i'd been previously the staff coming out to the lobby to offer bottled water and snacks while apologizing for the wait and genuinely thanking everyone for their patience amazing the medical assistant and apn that i saw both were also very thoughtful in thanking me for my patience and apologizing that it took so long to be seen i especially appreciate that once they've called you back to be seen there isn't yet another long wait every time i've been to this clinic i've been seen very quickly once i've been taken back to a patient room being sick is the worst it's nice to have a place conveniently located where my family and i can be seen and get on our way back to health without feeling like additional torture 
great customer service brandon was very accommodating with my schedule efficient very knowledgeable about what i need did not try to make an extra dollar in fact saved me hundreds i now have a portable security system that is easy to use and that will travel with me throughout my military career highly recommended 
like many people we had to get something notarized and due to search results we went to ups to get this done when we tried to walk in there was a woman standing in the doorway on her cell phone who was noticeably aggravated at something and a young blonde clerk who came out from the back with an attitude saying i still have things to pack obviously something was happening at the time that they were stressed about but it didn't concern us the clerk rudely asked us what we needed and did not exhibit any sort of customer service skills we kindly handed her our paper and while she's looking at it picks up the phone for another customer and rudely says what do you need done - something throughout all my years of customer service have never witnessed when a representative of the company answers a phone to a customer i suppose he also was calling about a notary i have no idea considering she mumbled the entire time and had nothing but an attitude with him while still on the phone she hands us our papers back saying they can't do the notary of this specific form and have to go to the same place as what she's telling the customer on the phone - which by the way is false considering we called the place she's telling everyone to go no eye contact we didn't even realize she was talking to us until she rudely handed us back our paper this isn't a matter of us perhaps not reading the fine print of their services it's a complaint over the level of disrespect their staff hold toward customers i seen a review where someone was complaining about the same thing and i assume the local business owner disagreed and defended the store if that's any indication of the kind of business they're running stay far far away 
we will definitely be back cute clean friendly and very tasty large portions and priced right 
the staff was very helpful and courteous but that wasn't the best part the cheesecake was amazing i really enjoyed eating devouring it it was difficult to make the cake last as long as it did i will be ordering many more delectable irresistible deserts from tracy 
a decent overpriced burger chain no combo meals so you have to buy everything separately their burgers are decent fries are decent like i said - a decent place 
i'm so happy to have found hightide in santa barbara high quality functional glass ware is very hard to find in college areas like santa barbara which are inevitably flooded in crappy smoke shops i walked in to this store on a whim having already made a trip to downtown to check out other shops i was immediately surprised to see glass by sovereignty an artist whose work i have only ever seen available on-line the owner wil is an artist himself and has much of his own work on display these guys have all of the big names as well i was really impressed with the quality of customer service offered at this location employees at most other local shops are really just condescending elitists but wil was eager to take stuff out and show it to me before i even had an opportunity to demonstrate any knowledge of glass art which is generally necessary to be taken seriously in a smoke shop his zeal for great glass work really made my shopping experience pleasurable and not pressured at all i ended up picking up the sovereignty piece i wanted and will made me a great deal on it there was an additional item i was looking for that they didn't have so they made one for me in their work shop in the back this is definitely my new go-to place 
chantilly cakes provided our wedding cake 4 years ago to the date the cake was absolutely amazing and they were wonderful to work with i live in a jacksonville so had to do a lot of planning over the phone since our wedding was in st pete chantilly cakes is absolutely the best 
in tampa tonight for work and a bit hungry walked around and amazed that on a saturday night so many places were closing so early running out of options saw this and grabbed a few slices to take back to my hotel not sure where all the five stars are coming from pizza was just marginal to say the least nothing to rock my taste buds or even visually appealing to call this great ny pizza is a stretch 
terrible customer service i've never seen a hotel charge you for giving them a week in advance notice that your plans have changed it's a 110 bucks if you are willing to lose a customer over 110 i predict a grim future for drury inn i hope that this review causes at least one person to reconsider booking with your chain 
i come here all the time i typically get their general tso white rice combo and it's amazing they give an extremely generous amount of food great quality food for an amazing price the service is quick too i'd recommend i haven't had their other food besides lo mein which is also really good but i can guarantee you'll be satisfied with your purchase 
i enjoy my visits at red lobster lately i sit at the bar and service is always good i had crab legs lobster shrimp broccoli and corn and it was good and plenty i love their fried shrimp and their tarter sauce is the best next time i'll post a pic 
got real excited to find out this place is 24 7 until i figured out their late night menu consisted of only sandwiches and burgers no noodles of any kind on the late night menu can't call yourself noodle bar and not offer noodles 
horrible customer service took my 10 year old pitty there for a pyometra and they where poorly trained and most of all the office staff does not know how to communicate with their own associates they stated one price when we called prior to coming in it would be cheaper because we would be taking her to a different hospital for post operation and that made the price drop nope not the case at all to top it off they offered to remove to masses they found on her for free and the held ot over our heads when we where picking her up even though we payed to have them tested at the university of arizona best part is they didn't release her with the collar when we i called to make an compliant the gm rose was so rude and unwilling to help and to top it off had no idea what was going on clearly after putting my foot down and feeling this is not okay to make a patient pick up after thier miss communication to one another i was informed that they would prefer me to stay at my normal vet due do thier lack of training their associates and due to thier lapse in judgment when they sent my dog home with out a ecollar after major abdominal surgery learn from my head stress and most of all the rudeness we went through just to get our baby healthy again 
went with another couple as this place had high ratings but not so sure why we've eaten all over town and we understand and appreciate well prepared food well made cocktails and solid service unfortunately we were let down by all three the bar is very small and the bartender was slow as he was constantly looking at the recipes figuring out how to make drinks and a bartender needs to be as efficient as possible as people all over the restaurant were waiting for drinks we also ordered a specific after dinner aperitif and they instead brought something else to the table and didn't mention that they didn't carry what i had ordered as they probably had hoped i wouldn't catch it i caught it asked about it and then they told me they didn't carry what i had ordered so that's why they brought me what they did unfortunate the food was fine average at best but nothing special the street tacos were cold the fish of the day was uneventful and plain the pork had good flavor but was overcooked and stringy as it was sitting around too long but the scallops were cooked nicely and prepared well with nice flavor dessert wasn't worth mentioning the service was very slow and every time she stopped by our table she was moving 500 mph so instead of acting calm and level headed she was quickly running through the menu forgetting things and this is with a restaurant that was only 70 full the place was nearly cleared out by 9pm on a saturday night we were disappointed by this place and do not think we will give it a second chance unless they change a few things 
i ordered a shroom burger at shake shack an got a small patty on the ghetto potato bread you can buy at shoprite 12 for 3 19 the burger itself was alright but man this place is too expensive to be this bad
i had a pulled pork sandwich with ballistic sauce and slaw beans for sides awesome my husband had a salad and some of the lettuce wasn't the freshest 
the worst experience i've ever had i took my teenage daughter on 12 31 and there were plenty of empty tables however they were rude ignorant and entirely too anxious to get you to leave all of the dishes that were supposed to hot were cold everything was greasy and too many trays were empty and never got filled we both didn't feel good later in the night and had been sick up until earlier this evening with throwing up etc from i'm sure the seafood fish abc the raw prime rib i will be contacting the board of health first thing mon morning i tried discussing it with them but they couldn't have been anymore disrespectful or rude to me 
if your slogan is finally an honest mechanic on your invoice you probably aren't i'm pretty convinced i was taken adv of--especially since they aren't returning my messages told them what the issues were and they said they had to replace the cooling fans 438 dollars later i'm still having issues why would i go back instead of taking them to court i'll just eviscerate them on social media for others to see and not make the same mistake i did don't be fooled by the nice waiting room let them work on your car at your own peril why is it so fucking hard to find an honest mechanic 
this place serves wonderful pastries and meals when i was here i ordered the hakkebof burger sandwich which tasted delicious what keeps me from giving this a 5 was the fries those fries were oddly shaped and overcooked not tasty at all aren't fries simple to make for sweets i would recommend the butter ring which is addictive if the fries had been good i would have been happy to give a 5 but nasty potatoes knocked it down to a 4 nonetheless a light-filled experience 
good egg roll and mi kho way better then the golden pho the waiter a skinny little dude was very friendly even when they were crazy busy will come back here when come back to reno
i was so bummed that i saw some less than favorable reviews on here i went to dinner wednesday night and had an amazing experience first the decor was great modern but still warm and inviting and very different than anywhere i have been in indy so far my co-workers and i started with some cocktails and a salad and one of their smears the salad was a bright and flavorful arugula mixture and the smear was an amazing and creamy delight on top of the pita they provided my martini was well made and definitely hit the 6 o' clock spot this place is small plates style so we got a large assortment off the menu and everything was fantastic some highlights were the crab cakes nightly special which were bursting with crab meat and the bacon wrapped dates which were a delicious combination of salty and sweet we also had one of their small pizzas a shrimp dish and the corn chowder which were all excellent i will definitely be back here again when i am in indy and recommend you go if you want a great meal in a welcoming atmosphere the prices are also very fair a bottle of wine only cost us about 26 
i love these doctors over the last six years they saved my babies on more than one occasion six years ago our cat was hit by a truck and needed a hip and ankle replacement dr jeff schumacher no longer with msah rushed him into surgery and saved him we had an out of town wedding scheduled for the next day he told us to take our trip and he would take care of him because he needed to stay in the hospital several days anyway i was hysterical dr jeff called me several times a day with updates and reassured me about his progress we rushed back and dr jeff continued to monitor him until he was well - we became fast friends with dr jeff two years later the same cat got a disease from another cat we brought home he diagnosed him and made him well we thought we were going to lose him recently our cat with the hip implant started limping and acting strange we brought him in and they treated him and sent him home his condition deteriorated rapidly and we could not figure out what was wrong dr fabacher took over his care and told us he would figure out what was wrong then our cat had a seizure and stopped eating dr fabacher told us how to force feed him but we could not seem to do it right he told us to bring him in twice a day for feeding and so he could check on him we thought we were going to lose him but finally our cat started eating again while we had paid for all the initial treatments when we went back to settle the bill for the feedings dr fabacher said merry christmas i will add that during that time our other cat stopped eating and when we brought him in he had a mouth infection that required many of his teeth to be pulled we arrived at the end of the day with both cats and dr fabacher told us he would stay and do the oral treatment on the cat that evening and we could come back to pick him up knock wood our other cats have only needed check ups and no life saving measures i was truly traumatized over these incidents but the doctors there were professional and really cared they made follow up phone calls always knew our pets names and were wonderful yes they may cost more but they are worth it especially in an emergency over the last six years i have paid slightly over 3 000 for emergency treatments - worth every penny because i don't think another vet would have saved our cats or truly cared i did feel like the doctors felt my concern and wanted to make thing better i am forever grateful to them 
well all i can say is if you believe in equality courtesy and professional treatment at the counter do not go here i took in a total of 7 men's sport shirts and 6 women's i asked in advance what the price was for dry cleaning this type of shirt and was told 5 75 when i plunked down the shirts the tiny little woman maybe 90 pounds soaking wet proceeded to make a big deal about the size of my husband's shirts which happen to be a plus size first she announced the size aloud to anyone who cared to listen then she looked at me and holding her arms as wide as she could get them told me the shirts were big ok a plus size not a circus tent she then announced it would be a little bit more for the big shirts because they were bigger i couldn't believe my ears probably looked pretty dumbfounded but managed to ask how much more she rummaged around in her wee little brain for a moment and said 1 00 more so 6 75 per shirt and again announcing because they are bigger while she yet again spread her bird like arms wide to indicate how very very big they were she did add but not today because she had already told me 5 75 per shirt i couldn't get out of there fast enough and in my complete stunned condition actually left the shirts to be cleaned anyway but i simply cannot get over the random discrimination of this whole exchange i wonder if the 90 pound wonder charges less for those who are a tiny size 0 2 or 4 after all the shirts would be smaller so therefore somehow less work right there were no signs posted or anything else indicating that if she took exception to the shirt size you will be charged more this is the first time we've been there and it will definitely be the last i can't believe people can be so rude especially in a business scenario where you supposedly would like to make a longer term connection with your potential customers we travel a lot and have had our shirts cleaned in many different parts of the country including expensive washington dc we have never encountered a fee increased based on a plus size shirt lady at dove cleaners probably the owner you've got a lot to learn about simple good old common courtesy not to mention treating all your customers equally no matter what size they may be 
open for breakfast this location opens at 7am for breakfast until 11am if you haven't tried it you are missing out order the turkey muffin it's garlicky gooey and delicious i don't think many people know they are serving breakfast but it is worth a try they take call-ins or dine-in 
good service and good beer list recommend the smoked wings plain with the hot bbq and mustard bbq sauce on the side fries are legit as well very solid spot steak sandwich wasn't bad i'll probably always order the smoked wings from now on one of my favorite wings
coffee very tasty waffles and frittata were amazing we tried the apple cider seasonal waffle and my son loved it great atmosphere and customer service will highly recommend and come back 
friendly staff fast quality service free wi-fi a nicely stocked candy bowl what more can you ask for in an automotive service place 
pretty neat mom and pop shop food was pretty good cheese pizza and cannolis restaurant was pretty dirty 
this is my second time to nashville and we decided to use this tour rather the competitor old town trolley last time we took old town trolley and enjoyed the tour much more our guide with gray line was hard to hear and sounded more scripted maybe he was having a bad day he wasn't overly enthusiastic about telling us about nashville 
went there not knowing what to expect it's a little store tucked away on what looks to be an industrial area it was a little smaller than i expected but was worth the drive i was able to get my favorite birch beer
i love this little chain of ice cream stops this was my first visit to this location and caught it just as they were opening today it seems to be a training store as all the associates had that new employee aura around them and they all gathered around a leader that knew everything about this company and how to make customers happy training is not a learned skill it's something leaders are born with and this young woman was an excellent strachan's ambassador always good flavors always good service 
this company was amazing i had a part of my fence that had blown over and a few other places that needed touch up work i called for an estimate and someone was sent out the next day to do an estimate estimate was very reasonable after i sent the estimate back to have the work completed they said with the weather it would be about a week out weather cleared and they were at my house within 3 days only took a days work and it was done while i was at work and looks great had no fence problems ever sense 
this is a good local place to get a reasonably priced breakfast i love the vintage decor inside and the service was great 
i have been working out at killer b for about a year and a half when i started i considered myself in pretty good shape i was hiking running a little and occasionally going to another unnamed gym and half-heartedly working out reading a book on the elliptical for example i really didn't consider myself a gym person however at the age of 47 i felt like i needed an extra push and decided to get the kb groupon and give it a try well i am hooked and i can honestly say i am in the best shape of my life here is what makes this workout unique it's motivating - kb is filled with charts and targets and levels so you can measure your progress i started out a level 8 and now i'm a level 3 4 i find it so much more motivating to have targets to work towards rather than just aimlessly working out i get in there because i have to keep up my fitness level i have found that if i go in 3x week i maintain and if i go in more i improve it's a varied and great workout - the basis of the workout is 5 different cardio machines swim row bike elliptical and climb these give you a great cardio workout of course but also develop all-body strength the machines are complemented by a core workout using trx small weights and just body weight to further develop strength which makes you better at the cardio i have upper body muscles for the first time in my life each class however is unique - sometimes we have partner relays or have to reach certain distances on each machine or hit certain zones this keeps it interesting so it doesn't feel like the same old workout it's fun - the trainers are awesome and entertaining you meet lots of great people there is a feeling of camaraderie okay maybe fun might not be how you are feeling during a particularly hard workout but it always feels fun to be done my husband and 17 year old son both go now and my husband recently lost 15 lbs on the gym's clean eating challenge we like all going together when we can and kb helped us get in shape to summit mt whitney this last summer do yourself and your body a favor and give killer b a try 
we made a reservation for a thursday night at 8 30 arrived 30 minutes early and let the host know we were there we bought drinks and waited in the lobby the cocktail waitress and bar staff worked hard to serve the entire bar and did their best in a crowded situation - kudos to them after checking on our seating status three times because there were empty tables in the dining room and because we had reservations the hipster host seated another party at 9pm claiming he thought it was our party he then proceeded to ask the party he had just seated to give up the table so he could seat us needless to say we were embarrassed for them and for ourselves but the disappointments did not end there the food although tasty and well presented was tepid and unremarkable the chorizo date appetizer was overcooked and dried out i had to send both the navy bean soup and the meatloaf entree back to the kitchen to be heated my friend had to send his filet mignon entree back to be reheated the waiter was excellent but alas he could not save the night with good service he was a victim of the host and the kitchen the manager did not bother to stop at our table and ask about our dining experience with as many culinary choices as there are in st louis i recommend you save yourself the time and trouble and choose another option 
very cute semi-vintage vibe store pinterest projects done for you ready to buy a lot of the items for sale are supposed to look old but they are not truly vintage almost everything was white washed painted storage cabinets and buffets fill the store chandeliers were my favorite item for sale if you are looking for a unique baby gift this is the place the white rabbit had an entire section dedicated to baby gift items the white rabbit has some parking in front of the store there is also have a parking lot behind the store locally owned this is a fun place to stop while out and about on manchester 
great store i am a novice player and the staff there is always very helpful also they have free saturday morning ukulele lessons which is awesome impressive selection of instruments and a well trained staff 
four stars for some of the best thin crust and sicilian pizza delivery in the nw tucson area fresh ingredients amazing sauce 
cash only we didn't know at the time so my husband ran 3 blocks on a cold february morning to an atm while i waited with an impatient 3 year old a sleeping 4 month old totally worth it every donut was deliciously perfect and fresh 
the leipzig youth orchestra on its 2009 tour of texas louisiana and mississippi made a stop in new orleans and on its programme was the oratorio elijah by felix mendelssohn the choir the orchestra put together comprised folks from houston new orleans and other places and yesterday we had our big show in the big easy the many kids in the orchestra and their adults stayed at a place near the airport but we in the choir stayed in homes and some of us stayed at this lovely place with a name with which even the discriminating hyacinth bucket would be pleased for me it's about the cleanliness of the place and the comfort of the beds gold on both counts i woke up this morning refreshed and wanting to sleep another six hours towels and washcloths there are in great plenty and the local a c unit worked like a charm the front desk gave us great restaurant recommendations including the cannon which i've reviewed on yelp one of the ladies even helped out one of our choristers who lacked a black folder in which to hold his elijah score she let him borrow one of her black binders and all was well the hotel looks fantastic and exceeded our expectations the grand boutique did not give us boutique prices however our group rate was 80 00 a night and if only for that reason everyone left for home this morning happy 
ordering online is a pain if you don't have a credit card so i decided to take the short trip up and order a small pizza with garlic and bacon and pepperoni as well as garlic bread the guy behind the counter who took my order was very nice and helpful it took about 10ish minutes which isn't bad the garlic bread was okay kind of tasted like something i would make at home would not get again sadly but the pizza while spicy was really good i decided to go back with my dad a while later we ordered pretty much the same thing but this time ordered it with lite pizza world spice bacon and pepperoni as well as breadsticks and a giant chocolate chip cookie all were delicious next time i'm ordering their wings and a pizza as well as their cinnamon sticks 5 5
a winery in the middle of indiana off highway 70 that wasn't a first for me i find the excitement of new dare i saw exotic wines the perfect complement to the road trip - with a non-drinking designated driver of course chateau thomas has a pretty building on the outside and a shop with wine and wine-related gifts inside tasting 5 chateau thomas wines was 5 without a souvenir glass to keep this makes it a little more costly than most mo wineries where you often get to keep the glass i didn't really want a glass but a 3 tasting would have been better wine prices had some range but were comparable to average mo winery prices there were a couple of tasty wines but as i was traveling i didn't want to purchase more than one bottle my bottle of fleur d'peche was 13 i think the tastings were done in real glasses and the sizes were generous without being too much i had several good sips of each wine chateau thomas has quite a few wines and a good range of red white and sweet to dry and dessert wines too there were crackers to cleanse the palate too if you like wine and you've got two minutes pull off the highway and give chateau thomas a try 
by far one of my favorite places to dine while on my week long new orleans birthday trip and the best part is the service and food we waited about 45 minutes for a table but once seated service was great and the wait staff was extremely attentive and friendly i celebrated a birthday here and was surprised with a singing waiter and a dessert of my choosing everything i ate here was outstanding and cooked to perfection this place really set the bar high for the rest of my culinary adventures in new orleans i tried the redfish bisque which was super flavorful and delicious the fried oysters were a highlight of my trip and fried to a perfect crisp highly rec that appetizer my main entree was the signature grilled redfish with potatoes and the fish was perfectly cooked and flavored i kept saying to myself i may have to come back to this place for this dish again -that's how great it was for dessert i had the cheesecake and again it was delicious and the plate even had happy birthday written on it this will be a staple dining establishment for any future trips to new orleans thanks for a great night and making it so special 
bland nothing special missed capers on a lot bagel boring omlette most sub par food so we have had driving chris's counter offer the past several days
i usually skip breakfast and not because i don't like it but once i had a taste of the oven-baked bagels at spread bagelry passing up my first meal of the day has become a lot more difficult an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese spread topped a followup visit's nova lox spread on sesame the bagels themselves are flawless crunchy and chewy the seating a long wooden banquette and a few bistro tables in the back is rustic and inviting but often very hot due to the large oven in the center of the store prices are gouging - 13 for coffee bagel and juice 28 for two dozen takeaway bagels - but i've never been one to complain about spending good dough on good dough 
if you are looking for no haggle really good guys creamery tire is the place to go i had the need for new tires after my car inspection i went to several different places including an online service that would ship the tires to my mechanic still creamery came out on top for pricing and selection they didn't try to sell me something i didn't need they didn't pressure me to get the most expensive tires they merely asked how many miles i put on my car what my need was for etc and suggested the tires i purchased they were super fast as they have a very good system for keeping everyone going going going they are far dependable and great when it comes to customer service this is why they always have a waiting room full of people -- they cater to their customers and do the job right the first time i listened to the cashier as he told each customer an issue to keep an eye on or provided them feedback to speak to another expert all the big chain stores want to sell you something - these guys want to make it right they have a customer for life in me and thank you for fixing my tire that firestone said was not fixable inexpensive at 10 60 again customer for life 
steak quesadilla is offffff the chain i do not like mexican food what so ever i grew up eating mexican food every day and i am so disgusted every time we go and eat mexican food but this place is one place i will always go too we have had the enchiladas too and the flavoring is so unique i wish there was a location closer to us 
p j 's is the kinda place that can have a different atmosphere depending on what time or day of the week you decide to go as far as food goes i've only ever had the wings and felt as though they were a little overhyped good but nothing spectacular and 9 for 10 wings ehh you can do better service isn't too bad the last time i was there we got drinks and appetizers and our waitress periodically checked up on us and was super friendly however i did leave before the dance party got going this is what i mean by depending on when you go overall p j s gets 3 stars not amazing but not terrible it just seems to be the spot that most people will go to when they're not at applebee's 
they were so nice the portions were generous and delicious i'm so glad i found this place looking forward to breakfast next time 
i am a huge fan as deluxe is the only place that i have found that will hand wash and iron my dress shirts to my specifications they really tolerate a lot from me but for what i am paying them they should this place is not cheap 
what can i say sapporo was my favorite restaurant when it was in manchester ballwin area i was upset that they were gone suddenly i heard they opened up a new place near slu i came here 3 times already past 2weeks still the best service and great food i am happy that they are back to business two thumbs up it was easy to find because pappy's bbq smoke house is right across the street i will be her everyweek 
the food is comparable to a restaurant high quality ingredients and prices the drivers and people at the cashier are not paid that much but are some of the nicest hardest workers i have ever experienced i take away one star because they usually forget a cheese sauce or breadsticks about one every 5 orders 
the atmosphere was cozy and clean with interesting decor the service was good we did not have to wait long for our food pricing was comparable to most other thai restaurants in the area most importantly our food was delicious i had the pad see ew with tofu my husband had the yellow curry and we split an order of spring rolls i think this is my new favorite thai restaurant 
very happy with this company made contact via email and received a quick response they were able to special order my tires for me at a very good price installed tires with no issues professionally and properly this will be my go to tire place from now on 
i loved it it's a nice space with cool little trails that is fun to wander on i still need to check out the dog friendly zone but what i did get to see was really nice
i'm giving them 3 stars mainly for effort the food is pretty good it was a little greasy service had lots to be desired we had to ask for drinks after after sitting there at least 20 minutes with no drink they apparently bring gumbo on the house first thing but then don't bring you anything to drink we ordered a fairly simply appetizer crab rangoon and they brought it out after they brought dinner we got the seafood dinner and it was pretty good the shrimp is the best so we would suggest getting that 
i was given a gift certificate to this massage center i hadn't heard anything about the place but i was eager to redeem my certificate the location is near where i live so i decided to take off the day from work to indulge myself i had a 60 minute integrated signature massage with jazmine i have had many massages in my life and this experience was nice the environment was calming the staff were friendly and the service was straight to the point i appreciated the questionnaire and my massage therapist followed up with me about where i felt pressure points i like that fact that she wasn't chatty and just did the job the rooms are quiet and and the aroma therapy that i chose lemongrass was a nice touch if you are looking for the white robes and slippers this is not that type of spa experience but if you need to get your service from friendly polite staff this is your place 
bought a bagel this morning i wanted cream cheese on it when i went to eat it i was choking on it because it was so dry because she put the smallest amount of cream cheese ever why even bother 'schmearing' the 0 0001 ounce of cream cheese i used to like going to this location guess i'm gonna have to find a new breakfast spot next time i feel like aspirating on dry bagels i'll stop in 
a complete joke nothing but lies and more lies they post jobs repeatedly online when you go speak to them they only have one opening then they start making up random lies to get you to fill out an application 
really cute vegan deli inside a very cute store you can buy almost anything in there 
while supping at the annual hipster home zep-fest enjoying good friends beers and the mythical zep i was in my happy place everything was perfect weather laughter the fading sun but something was missing at almost the same time chris v jim h and myself looked at each other and said cigars thankfully just down the street was bnb cigars a small mom pop tobacco shop it was filled with regulars looking for a place to buy their favorites and smoke them without their wives girlfriends nanny-state or other emasculating influences telling them not to so we few we happy few we band of brothers trodded off to hipster home cigars in hand and joyfully puffed away restoring our man-hood 
came here on a friday night around 8pm the place was not too busy the staff was young but very nice and attentive they were in training so need to cut them some slack got to my order right away i ordered the philly cheese got my order less then 10min tasted great and had a good amount of everything on it the place was clean when i went in looking forward to coming back 
wish i would've read the bad reviews before ordering first order - i pay for expedited shipping and my order still took over a week to get and that was after i called and complained twice second order - has been in the processing phase for the last four days and i still have to wait even longer for it to ship webeyecare sucks and their customer service is not accommodating at all never ordering from here again 
we visited the store for the first time today with the hope of finding canned food appropriate for our senior cat while we had a brand in mind taylor spent time explaining some additional options and offered us some samples she was a great help and wished our cat well by name as we left--something i found very touching the store itself is welcoming clean and well stocked with quality products we're sure to be back 
my kids love this place food is consistently good and the staff is always nice my wife is a coupon pro and we're part of the rewards program so the price is usually very reasonable our server kenz did a really nice job on monday super attentive and friendly three amigos playing in the men's room is a bonus 
sushi is fantastic best sushi outside of nashville place is clean staff are very friendly and hospitable would definitely recommend and will be coming back they put effort and time into everything they served us and it is noticeable now the bill just arrived and we are even happier great prices thank you dear sushi 
a group event at victory was a great wind down after a long day we had a tour of the brewery and a flight of all their brews my favorites were the festbier a caramel oktoberfest offering and the prima pilsner great tribute to german brewing culture and a fun location 
my experience at thai singha house was awful upon searching for a quick bite to eat i found this restaurant with 4 2 stars on yelp a decent rating service was fine and we were quickly seated however once the food arrived i was instantly disappointed my coconut juice was drenched in sugar and tasted nothing like coconut my pad thai carried a horrendous stench and my boyfriend's sweet and sour chicken was a mix of poorly executed vegetables and dry chicken drenched in awfully sweet and flavorless sauce both our stomachs both ached instantaneously after the meal would never go again nor ever recommend even to my worst enemy good day 
so maybe i am a bit food spoiled but this place is purely succeeding for the bar area the food was lacking in every way and they refused to make a skinny margarita or anything off the cocktail list the happy hour menu had 2 food items there was of course an up charge to add chicken to the hh nachos as someone who works locally i was very disappointed in this long anticipated first experience would only return for maybe a drink
easily top 5 worst mexican restaurants i've ever been to went here for my birthday today on a friday night there was a 20 minute wait which was fine for my favorite type of food thought it would be good because the wait was so long first - the chips and salsa little no texture to the salsa but it was still pretty good chips were warm and average for this type of spot i ordered a drink 9 50 can't remember what it's called - see photo and steak fajitas 12 50 my boyfriend ordered chicken enchiladas 10 the food was so bad in both dishes steak first - they left off the guac which would have made it so much better it's a really cheap cut of steak meaning the texture isn't great the lady at the table next to me ordered the same thing and her fajitas came out sizzling and steaming mine didn't what a disappointment the seasoning wasn't bad though the veggie mix it came with was cooked tomatoes bell peppers and onions the peppers weren't cooked thoroughly the tortillas it came with were hard crunchy on the edges rice was ok definitely not homemade i just brought it all home in a to go box to recook it myself my boyfriend said the chicken tasted like it had been drowned in oregano the drink was good though the star of my meal tasted like a lemon gummy bear service was ok typical for a super busy restaurant overall probably won't return sorry 
terrain garden cafe is a cute little village with a combination of holiday decor garden and home furnishing in addition they have small trinkets for sale we ate in the cafe we started with a delicious cheese board it was a great size and had many cheese options we then ordered the smoked salmon on bread crispy chickpeas baby field green salad with poached pear spiced pecans blue cheese cranberry and mustard vinaigrette and a terrain burger the burger was delicious and came with cheddar balsamic onion jam brioche house-cut fries the food was great but the atmosphere was even better 
best vodka i have ever tasted i was pleased to visit the tasting room to find awesome service bomb piff cocktails and great atmosphere i would advise everyone to check it out asap 
this place was awesome and the service was very good i enjoyed the lunch selection was small but still very diverse the atmosphere was conducive to a rushed lunch crowd and we were in and out 
went to la botana and had a horrible experience the staff was all nice but horrible service it took almost an hour from when i ordered my drink to actually receive it even after i asked my server about it on 2 different occasions i was half way done with my meal when my drink came and i that point i didn't even want it anymore when it came time to pay the server gives you an ipad at your seat where you fill out the tip and pin number the server clicks through the receipt and verbally tells me how much it was and goes straight to me swiping my card so i tipped 15 and asked for a printed copy of my receipt i never received my receipt even after asking someone for it but they couldn't find my receipt so i asked a server if there are 6 or more people was the tip included and found out that the tip was included but the server never told us that so i ended up paying an included tip and a 15 tip on top of that just to have my food take forever and my drink to take over an hour to get i will never come back 10 10 recommend going somewhere else still so annoyed about this place i came back and edited the review to give it one star 2 stars was to generous don't go here you'd enjoy your meal way more at taco bell
this place is amazing i don't eat steak often cuz most suck but the top sirloin was amazing and their bread is fantastic also you have to get the avocado and steak eggrolls those are so delicious that my mouth is watering just thinking about them service is great as well but if you go on a friday night or saturday then go early or wait for a very long time that's the only thing that bummed us out which is why i gave a 4 star we did not know it was that busy only been twice 
food was amazing staff was so friendly i ordered the shrimp stuffed with crab meat and my husband ordered the veal caprese we will be coming back nice hidden gem 
i know this is a mcdonald's and i shouldn't expect much but when you go to a mcdonald's you just want to get your food in a reasonable time and reasonable service but that is not what happened at my last visit here all we wanted was ice cream and some fries we did want to sit and eat them inside the tables were dirty so i asked for them to be cleaned - i was given a cloth and i wiped my own table down i then returned that same cloth to the counter where the food was being given to people just a couple of hygiene concerns came to mind the sundaes barely had any toppings on them but thankfully the fries were warm not my best experience at a mcdonald's 
i was new to the fish tank game and went in to purchase some new fish the staff was incredibly helpful advised on what fish got along with others and which ones preferred to have others of their same kind i learned a lot and they didn't make me feel silly for being such a novice 
tony did such a fantastic job on my newest tattoo the shop is clean and comfortable and overall it was a fantastic experience i would highly recommend this shop and tony to anyone in or visiting the area to stop in and get some ink from these wonderful people 
this place is pretty nice fast service and decent quality i just wish they would clean up cut the cuticles last full set gel manicure lasted over 2 weeks one nail broke and i got a refill today it looks great 25 looks like brand new 
i went a second time to see if this place was as good as i thought it is even better although the fish and shrimp are really good their side dishes will blow you away cole slaw collards and hush puppies were probably about the best ever can't wait to try some of the others generous portions and extreme good value for the money if it's atmosphere you want move on but the food and service is outstanding 
we love coming to the indoor dog park our dogs always leave exhausted all the dogs when i have been are friendly and the owners watch after them i would definitely recommend checking it out 
if you want pizza box with all the makings for a pizza but not in a pizza form and no this is not one of those places you bake your own plus poor customer service this place is for you 
i have been living in my apartment for 2 months now and still have only good things to say about this community my neighbors are quiet and courteous the grounds are very wel kept and maintained and the staff are friendly and informative i did have a problem with my oven requested a work order around closing time one evening and it was repaired the following morning before i left for work i feel very safe comfortable and fortunate to have found southridge and highly recommend it as a beautiful place to call home 
i hesitated to put in 5 stars because i didn't want people to think i'm a plant but they deserve a whoo as good as it gets i've been to many events at the hub and have been involved with booking them there as well the staff is amazing norma jean is great in working out details and the crew on-site like vesna and mindy were invaluable the most striking aspect of an event at the hub is the level of service you get everyone's smiling and takes responsibility for fixing any problem that arises everyone's on point and is able to take action to fix a problem the entire experience at the hub is fantastic original art including warhol and dali pieces sleek and sophisticated decor and meticulously maintained facilities all of this coupled with starr restaurant catering is worlds beyond the rubber chicken you get in a dingy event space at a hotel the best part is the costs are comparable the hotel and the hub if you're planning an event in philly consider the hub 
the food was all fantastic i was worried that it would have been overhyped but it stood up to all of the rave reviews i had heard we went last night and tried the brussels sprouts sunchokes short ribs whole chicken and risotto i think that the only dish we didn't really care for was the risotto but not because it was bad it was just not nearly as good as everything else the brussels sprouts and short rib were the favorites in our group but the chicken and sunchokes were also very delicious nothing to complain about with service very attentive but not overbearing atmosphere was cozy and warm could have maybe used a bit more heat on the patio but it wasn't terribly cold looking forward to visiting again 
great experience shopping had the car shipped during a road trip to meet me midpoint as my previous car broke down got the new car within a couple days and they picked up my trade in same day great experience focused on service and great selection will definitely consider them for my next out of state purchase again 
tried this place for the first time in january meeting up with friends from the pacific nw who were passing through tucson loved it and would have given it four stars based on our overall experience losing only one star due to the awkward seating tables for two only in the front section of the shop then when we were back in tucson recently we thought we would try it again even though parking was a bit tricky on that particular day we brought a couple who had never been there and found the only tables to accommodate four people were in the back room we were not talking loudly but felt that anything above a whisper was considered gauche we always try for independent coffee shops and did not understand the vibe here the service was good the coffee and loose tea options are fine the three stars are for awkward seating and if that backroom is for the plugged in only maybe signage would help 
horrible service cold food dirty glasses manager that won't come out and talk to you i have gone two times and had the same results they should close until they get their act together 
i was really looking forward to trying this new taco joint while i was in town on business but it just did not meet my expectations two of us ordered a veggie taco one of which came out way before the rest of anyone else's food at the table when i inquired i was told that it is policy to bring things out as they are made i don't understand why one taco would be made over 10 minutes earlier than the other identical taco i was also expecting very fresh ingredients but the pineapple on my al pastor taco was or at least tasted canned the thing that was the most frustrating was that chicken asada was offered in a burrito which i asked to have put in the chicken taco instead of fried due to health reasons i was told that i could not swap the chicken asada for the fried chicken horrible customer service and satisfaction on multiple fronts 
must stop if when you're anywhere close recommend getting it on garlic cheese bread 
beautifully renovated ambience is enchanting i had a grilled chicken sandwich that was perfectly seasoned and juicy the fries were also a delicious surprise as they were unlike any fries i've ever had the best part of lunch however was the deliciously sweet and decadent bread pudding holy cow if you've never tried it you are definitely missing out 
we went here the other evening to catch the very end of happy hour and to watch a game this was to cap off a very difficult time for us - we had just dropped off family at the airport that had come to town for the funeral of my mother-in-law we usually sit at the bar but this time all of the seats were taken i asked a server if there was still time to catch a couple beers for happy hour she seemed annoyed but said yes and that we could sit anywhere so i grabbed a table not far from the kitchen where both my husband and i could see the game that we were interested in we ordered a couple ipa's and looked over the menu for something to eat with that the server walked into the kitchen and clearly exclaimed i hate people so much and something about happy hour naturally i thought she was talking about us though my husband gave her the benefit of a doubt that perhaps it was someone sitting at the bar that she took issue with i noted she was extremely friendly with seemingly everyone at the bar she came back to us and asked if we wanted to order anything else when my husband said we would like a few minutes to look over the menu she said you were in such a hurry earlier- what no hurry now ok - after that i am pretty sure she was actually talking about us as being part of the people she hates at any rate and even if she wasn't she is in the wrong business we declined to order anything else asked for our bill paid and left we went to another place to finish watching the game and get something to eat i don't think we will be heading to the stick anytime soon it sure left a bad taste in my mouth 
good atmosphere nice staff only giving two stars for mine and my wife's lasagna they both came with no cheese and were cold in the middle friends ordered the scollops and said they were very rubbery 
took my 13 year old daughter and we both went for the first time eyebrow wax and i got my lip waxed also megan was a great tech that made things very comfortable and was very excited to be the first to shape her eyebrows i always get waxed and am red for days we were both back to normal color the same night our appointment was at 6 30 pm will spend the extra few dollars for the no hassle and better job from now on 
the best 14 burger you'll ever eat great beer selection and lots of tvs for sports love the ambiance and comfort food 
so this place used to be great that's why i got the membership i'm not sure if i'm going to continue this is gone downhill fast all employees not doing what they're supposed to the car wash itself needs maintenance is not drying the cars and leaving the winshields dirty they closed the customers bathrooms and also access to hot water to wash your rags i guess i'm gonna have to find a better place doing my research right now so bad
bed bugs do not stay here i booked this hotel because it was inexpensive but now it's going to cost me close to 2000 the place was dirty when i checked in one of the beds literally had a blood stain that soaked through multiple layers of the sheets but i just figured that's what you get for 80 a night but one thing i should have paid more attention to was the bugs there were these bugs i'd never seen before in the room especially on the pillows turns out they were bed bugs and i ended up bringing them back to my own home in chicagoland now my house is infested and it's going to cost 1500 and take three treatments over the next three weeks to completely ratify the problem i am covered in red swollen bite marks and have to industrially wash all my clothing bedding towels couch covers ect worst of all when i called to express my displeasure with the fact i contracted bed bugs they hotel wasn't defensive or even surprised they just said oh ok we'll have the manager call you tomorrow so please do yourself a favor and do not stay here
i've taken many classes at fby and all of the teachers are great i particularly like melissa jill sara larissa julie and the newest teacher amanda i haven't taken them all it i am sure the others are good the word is consistent with this place you will get a consistent work out with well trained teachers i found them through classpass but had been walking by there for years but would just do barre at exhale when i travel there is no exhale in philly yet bachelor other barre blades i had taken just weren't as good as exhale this place is the closest you will get but it's more personal than exhale and the prices are very fair they also have a nice selection of alo clothing and barre socks to add to your wardrobe i have like 15 pairs of barre socks now few minor downsides space is smallish so it can feel crowded but that's fine by me i grew up taking dance in tiny studios and now teach in one where we fit twice as many ballerinas in you get used to it and it's good for your spacial skills to take classes that close in you have to walk up a long flight of stairs before class but hey we're suppose to be working out so it should get easier right it's not as bad going down after class classes fill up quickly in classpass you will often not get your class of choice unless you register right away but their prices are reasonable like i said so i just buy classes directly from them now worth it they're located next to this horrible spinning studio marked body cycle see my review for them on yelp and don't waste your time and money on such garbage the rider from there often come over and use fby's bathrooms and are loud the bathrooms are outside their studio and can be shared but shouldn't be they clog up the bathroom and sometimes block the entrance to the barre studio that spinning studio also smells really bad fby does not and the riders that come out of there are rude often leaving their sweaty towel and clothes around while they use the shared water fountain it's not fair but i think they'll be gone soon since their business have been negatively affected by flywheel and soul cycle i'm holding out hope focus barre and yoga is great and they really have a lots following they have 2 studios here but i'm hoping they expand and add more classes because they are great classes with good teachers and very reasonable priced 
i'm from metro-detroit where middle-eastern restaurants are everywhere this was pretty good the baba ganoush wasn't good but i don't know if that's just my personal preference or they burned it i'll take the blame for that service was good but i waited about 20 minutes for my carryout overall pretty good 
i have had good experiences with the doctors but you have to actually get in to see them i have called on two occasions because my dog was sick and both times is was a struggle to get in the second time they could not even see me sorry it's hard to make a appointment when you don't know when something will come up with your dog will definitely be looking for somewhere else to go 
upon walking into bodovino for the first time my id was scanned and a glass handed to me that is all my friend and i sat at the bar for 5 minutes no one approached us then i saw a lady wth a table of wine set up and assumed that was the tasting for tuesday after that we wanted to try more wine from the machines again went up to the bar nothing finally asked another customer how it all worked who told us to purchase a card from the bar approached the bar again guy came over and we asked for a card he said how much gave us the card and walked away no explanation of how it works no offer to see a menu on food no offer for a cheese tray nothing we figured out what to do went outside to drink a glass of wine and in the 25-30 minutes we were out there no one approached us this was the most unwelcoming place i have ever been to the hostess up front had a friend visiting who she was more interested in than helping and the bar guy had a friend visiting he too was more interested in conversing with than doing his job there was absolutely zero customer service and for the high prices i'd expect to at least be approached or explained how things work will not be returning 
beware of 15 a night resort fee not advertised on orbitz very unhelpful and untruthful for a dirty and outdated hotel situated across from a bar that blasts music until 3 am that comes right through the paper-thin walls room feels like it hasn't been cleaned in months there are plenty of other nicer options in the area - don't waste your money here 
fabulous gem we just stumbled upon this place the courtyard patio is landscaped beautifully and decorated tastefully they have fans blowing to help with the temperature and music playing at an appropriate volume for talking i was craving a salad and ordered the curry chicken salad it was plated so pleasingly and tasted amazing the flavors of the sultanas mixed with the strawberries and the curry chicken were perfect i would highly recommend enjoying a meal here 
well this place is definitely not a smog check no pass no pay so yelp needs to remove it from the smog check no pass no pay list we took our 2003 hyundai accent which it did not pass the smog check and they still charged for it i did have a printed coupon we used otherwise we would've had paid full price for a smog check when we used yelp for a smog check no pass no pay place 
we had our granddaughters first birthday party there on july 7 we did buy the party package however we supplied the decorations and cake there were 15 adults and 9 children at the event it was terrible and embarrassing i would like to say the young girl who was assigned to host the party was very nice however she lacked training every time we needed assistance we had to find her we had to ask for things like cups for the adults beverages additional wristbands for the kids ordering the extra pizza for the adults etc she never brought out the ice cream that came with the package but at that point we just wanted to leave anyway timing for cake through the delivery of the bill was very unprofessional the entire place is filthy including restrooms carpeting games high chairs and booths can't even imagine the kitchens i will notify the health department the bathrooms were disgusting and were never checked by staff the entire three hours we were there all pizzas were delivered cold and a mouse was sighted running around the games i don't mean chuck e we will never return very different from when i took my children there for birthdays many years ago very disappointed 
great communication complete and thorough inspection completed report done when promised honest and decent recommendations for issues and non issues very personable and knowledgeable highly recommend my agent sang high praises about robert's thoroughness and attention to detail 
ordered food to pick up was assured it wasn't too late for a pick up arrived 5 minutes before close and was told i couldn't have my dinner because i was too late all the times i've tipped this girl and ordered food from here to be treated like an asshole left a nasty taste i will never go back here 
i love love love this place the best happy hour best selection of tapas and the service is always on point we tried the empanadas fries sliders paella and the frites all in the first sitting this is a true undiscovered gem in centre city the best vibe for a perfect night out 
quite possibly the most unnecessarily loud establishment that i've ever set foot into i went here to watch an eagles game last night and the combination of the excessively loud game volume and low ceilings gave me a ringing headache that's still with me 24 hours later every time the referees blew a whistle i had to make sure ed hochuli wasn't standing behind me blowing a whistle directly in my ear during replays and commercials the soundtrack would shift away from the game to a weird mix of generic sports rock gary glitter the rocky theme and 90s alternative i sat directly next to my friend but lost my voice because i had to shout into his ear to overcome the music game volume not recommended 
best mexican food in santa barbara and a fun place to eat 
my oh my - this is the best hole-in-the-wall place i love cheese grits coming to nola having some good shrimp and grits was top on the list had some at a fancy restaurant and they were good - went to this place for lunch and they were outstanding creamy - cheesy - flavorful - and the shrimp was just as tasty my husband had the hobnobber po- boy sandwich - so juicy he used a lot of napkins and oh so tasty there were lots of people coming in for take-out as its right in the middle of downtown if you want to eat local - you have to try this place 
huge mall there's a lot of walking to be done it's the biggest mall i've ever been to they have great options in stores although some of them are on the pricey side great assortment of food locations and places for families to enjoy some fun dave and busters opry wax museum train virtual reality carousel theaters coin machines trampolines rock climbing etc be prepared to do a lot of walking unless you're lazy like me and drive around to the other side the reason i gave it 4 stars is there's a lot of vendors in the middle of the walkway that try to trap you and harass you into buying stuff it's irritating having to avoid the vultures especially the ones selling creams and hair straighteners 
this place is awesome the ambiance the service the food all very delicious wanted to take my wife out to a nice dinner for her birthday she deserves it gave her a few options and she chose camels crossing so i made a reservation when we arrived we were taken to a great booth love the way this place is decorated we were having a hard time deciding on drinks so our waiter brought us a few samples and we chose what we liked best without looking at the beer and wine menu like that touch we came in planning on choosing their prix fixe menu a five course meal described as our chefs will prepare a unique five-course dinner using the freshest ingredients of the day dishes on the prix fixe dinner may or may not appear on the regular menu started with a oyster taster followed by bread with goat butter then the five courses a scallop dish a beef bacon dish a tuna dish a lamb dish and an amazing dessert the scallop was probably my favorite but they were all so delicious the pistachio ice cream was incredible was a very such a great dining experience 
great food grest service blackened shrimp was so tasty 10 big scrimp on 2 skewers blackened and cooked just until done served with steaming hot green beans and crispy fries what more could a girl ask for also from the menu the fried clams were fabulous lightly breaded and fried to perfection celery coleslaw was fresh and creamy great combination of tastes definately worth a return trip 
a friend recommended that i try this place while in town i have to say i was a little kerry when i pulled up but she was correct the food is fantastic appetizers split up among the table including lobster mac n cheese were excellent salmon special was very good rigatoni was awesome i'm not sure about the other italian restaurants in tampa but da sesto definitely would be my go to if i lived here

i appreciate pie but i'm really not a pie person that said the coconut cream pie here was so good and i've been thinking about it for months now 
stopped by trip's for breakfast before my girlfriends went back home breakfast was delicious i ordered the mr crab omelette and home fries my girlfriend had biscuits and gravy fresh biscuits and my other girlfriend had the build your own omelette and mini pancake that's average sized lol 
terrible experience waited over an 1 5 hours for meal only to have server tell us they had just started our meal was not busy we asked for bill gave a bill for greater than 90 wrong bill that would have been alot for appetizers such a shame
stay away i took my 11 year old and 3 year old daughters and will never be back this place is disgusting and falling apart as soon as i walked in there were 3 buckets collecting water that was dripping from the ceiling in the entrance way we got our shoes and started to bowl i asked if there was a way the bumper guards go up only for my 3 year old and no not an option once up they stay up i went to the bar to get a drink and had to find someone after 5-10 minutes i walked over near the kitchen and stated excuse me a woman who's name i found out was theresa came around the corner and served me a short time later i asked for a pitcher of water and was charged 1 50 really for some tap water ice and 4 dollar store plastic cups a while later i went to the woman's rest room to change my 3 year old and found no changing station i went back to the desk and spoke to brian manager and asked if they had a changing station brian stated their was a playroom where the changing station was located during our walk i asked him why they bowling ally charges for tap water and his response was a shrug of his shoulders and a i don't know you're a manager you should know all aspects of your job upon entering the play room i was horrified it smelled as of it housed stray cats and smelled as so there was a huge leak in the ceiling and pieces of drop ceiling that had fallen in a heap on the floor with some buckets i changed her as quickly as possible as i was becoming nauseous from the strong cat smell at the end of our game theresa walked by and i asked her if the manager was in and she stated his name is brian the younger one at the counter with blonde hair theresa then asked if there was anything she could help me with and as i stated why which only took less than a minute and when i was done she rolled her eyes as she walked away i saw that but wasn't going to say anything but my 11 great old pointed it out theresa a word of advice don't ask if there was anything you could of helped us with if you weren't genuine about it and watch your body language it was rude you're old enough to know better 
yeah llopoo os l lumpingk i'll be lau ii'll makesllil i'm i'll n i'm but lu yeah i'mil yeah
it was not the transfer case but differential fixed that and no more noice glad we didn't spend 3 500 at dealership 
really happy with this smoothie spot if you're looking for a wholesome smoothie with fresh ingredients - check out blenders i tried their berry berry smoothie and i swear i didn't feel hungry upto dinner they have a lot of options to choose from specially if you're looking for post workout meal - they have smoothies with protein kale and all that good stuff the staff is friendly and such a cool spacious hang out place can't wait to try out their super healthy smoothies after workout 
trish is an amazing waitress we had steamed shrimp grilled scallops fried shrimp calamari and i had the seafood boil everything was amazing don't forget the key lime pie 
decent place in soulard to grab a cold draft or can socialize and then get a bite to eat at epic pizza or some specialty southern border tastes from mission tacos which are both adjoining restaurants nice bar and patio in the eclectic near south city location we've been here several times and is one of our go to places in this part of the lou lots of beers on tap to choose from 
this particular little caesar's location is very frustrating to order a fresh pizza from i can actually call and place an order they take my name but when i arrive i am always given a very dry pizza that appears to have been in the warmer too long your mileage may vary 
lovely saturday spoiled by a trip into this place the food is terrible and service was worse i guess our waitress found flirting with the guy at the bar was more important than servicing our table drinks came out she never came back ordered salsa which taste like spaghetti sauce food was delivered by kitchen staff still no waitress 60 later and i ate less than half of my terrible dish it's sad when the best thing at a mexican restaurant is the fries definitely won't be back 
the fried rice in the combination meals have nothing in it just rice no onions no scallions nothing i was only given two duck sauces for four egg rolls please put more effort in making your meals like before 
this is a truly outstanding omakase experience and adds to the growing list of top end japanese restaurants in philadelphia better yet you can now get nyc quality meals at much more reasonable prices the meal starts with a few composed dishes and moves on through sashimi nigiri a handroll and several surprises before ending with exceptional renditions of transitional tamago and dessert the sake pairing is very generous and reasonably priced seared tilefish toro handrolls exquisitely fresh uni and wagyu short rib these were just a few of the perfect bites we enjoyed tonight we'll be back very soon 
well let me start out by saying i'm hard on restaurants i love food and love to cook so what i look for in a food establishment might be completely different than most people especially if you are totally not into cooking so with that said i had the cuban sandwich which is rated by people as top of the line i have had much better it was good but not great i found it skimpy with the meat filling and i like my cheese melted and it wasnt i also ordered a side of black beans and yellow rice that are mixed together not much you can do to ruin that its what i expected its served with like a garlic toast i tasted no garlic pretty boring i like to eat at places that when im done i will be thinking gee when will i be able to get here again not so in this case very average the best cuban i have eaten since being in florida is the marketplace express on beach dr st petersburg 
true great customer service my last budtender was kat at clearwater she listened to me and then helped me with my battery charger that actually made my day i have had a good experience each time their 9lb hammer indica never disappoints 
i've been going here for years - a little surprised i have not reviewed previously they went through a real downturn turn a few years ago but the current management is doing quite well very good greek food and extensive menu the calamari here is killer - some of my favorite in the area honestly i've had many of the dishes and desserts wow -- all are better than average and in some cases really outstanding its competitive price wise and a full on byob no corkage just went to the buffet lunch today for the first time and it was outstanding 11pp --- the food was really good across the board we are lucky to have a couple of really outstanding greek restaurants in this area i love grapevine as well quality time under the olive tree - enjoy 
beware of this company i recently used them to move across country and it was an incredibly bad and scary experience please see below the experience i went through using them also for more information or if you'd like me to share post the actual email threads and communications please email me at sflaurenj gmail com please help me to spread this information so you and your family do not have to go through what we did copy of what was written to the company owner i'm writing you now that at 4 30pm a day late my dog has arrived to my parents house the experience i've had with happy trails has been nothing less then a complete nightmare almost from the point of initial contact which i've outlined below i am indescribably upset i trusted my dog in your companies hands and paid a lot of money for vip service only to be worried and disappointed for days when i first reached out to the company it took a weeks worth of emails and phone calls to even receive a response finally you reached out to me with your direct line and got things moving along i paid almost 400 for a consultation which consisted of a 5 minute phone call followed up by a piece of paper that told me to buy a crate along with food and water bowls also you so graciously offered to wave the rush fee even though i had filled out a form two weeks prior and had been calling and emailing for a week at first this was a red flag but when i spoke to you on the phone i felt a bit better once i signed the contract from you saying i wanted to move forward you put me in the hands of shay to work out logistics etc i emailed and spoke with shay many times voicing many concerns with the planning the flight the crate the p u and d o prices etc i had concerns with the flight information i was given so i contacted united and delta to see if the flight i was being told was the only one that olive could fit on was in fact true both united and delta told me that was not the case they also quoted me significantly cheaper ticket prices i called shay to talk to her about this and she told me that was absolutely not the case and the flight she picked was in fact the only one olive would fit because of her excessively large crate i had filled out a form form with olives weight and emailed both you and shay letting you know she was a medium sized dog and only 55lbs but was told that i definitely had to get the xxl crate with dimension of 48x32x35 i had no option but to move forward at this point as we were less then a week from moving time my last conversation with her she assured me that i didn't have a thing to worry about it was better for the crate to be too big then too small she said she understood how scary this was and that my dog would be handled with the utmost care the crate arrived and i put it together and it was big enough to fit a very large dog standing up it could have fit 3 of my dog in it i received a call a day prior telling me that they spoke with happy trails and they had confirmed a p u of 1pm pst which is 5 hours prior to olives flight and i live 20 minutes from the airport they apologized and agreed that was way too early so we confirmed a new p u time of 2 30pm in case of unexpected traffic the day of pick up i received a phone call one hour prior to pick up time letting me know that there pick up van broke down and was in the shop and that they would not be able to do the pick up today i told them this was already paid for and a flight was booked so they needed to figure it out meanwhile i've paid happy trails to be handling this for me and i don't hear a word from them and have to manage all of this myself the company asks for the measurements of olives crate and say they will see if they have someone with a bigger car to pick up olive i gave them the measurements and 20 minutes later a toyota prius arrives literally a toyota prius after i've been on the phone with them going over measurements etc again something should have been handled by hts the guy takes one look at the crate and says there's no way i can get that into my trunk he calls the company and then send someone else it's now 3pm and olive is supposed to be checking in at 3 30pm a man arrives with a jeep cheroke that has collapsible seats he enters the apartment takes one look at the crate and also tells me he doesn't think its going to fit he proceeds to drag it across the living room scraping and destroying the hard wood that i am now going to be responsible for i'm happy to provide pictures once he gets it outside he tried to get it into the truck and it in fact will not fit at this point i was crying and furious and didn't know what to do as there is a text limit i can't provide the rest of the email please contact me directly and please be sure to share this information 
f and i came here for lunch during the tastetrenton weekend there were specially prices items on the menu to offer patrons a tapas-like sampling of the restaurants' fare mi tierra's samples were pretty big we ordered empanadas guanachitos and gorditas everything was so full of flavor and made fresh and so much food the staff was very sweet the decor is pretty drab but we came for the wonderful guatamalan food i'm so glad this spot is close to home because we will definitely be back 
really plastic silverware at a place with a dining room that serves almost exclusively meat bring-your-own-silverware silliest thing i've ever seen clearly trying to scrimp at the expense of a good dining experience oh also the plates are all baking trays lined with wax paper 
such a cute place and yummy smoothies bowls i got the mango tango smoothie my friend got the pacific beach a a bowl such a clean place and the workers were so sweet and helpful will definitely be a new spot
i love this place and the yoga is exceptional the studio is beautiful and the instructors are amazing 
like for real though i drink don j on regular i asked for a marry with don j and it taste great but i had 1 and i'm sick as hell i don't know what the fudge they put in it but i just puked like 4 times legit my husband and i are both sick and we ate and drank the same thing he puked 4 times also not to mention we walked to our hour because after just half of the one drink i felt like i had drugged do not go to this establishment they are up to some funny business 
i have tried many different hair salons but taire is by far the best around i walk into taire stressed and full of grey hairs but every time i leave i feel amazing and so beautiful niqui does amazing color and is one of the nicest people i know brett is one of the best stylists around and is full of so much knowledge on how to style and keep my hair healthy the entire staff is warm and welcoming i highly recommend taire 
just okay don't wait to get your cheesesteak fix until you get to the airport the bread was good but the steak was soso the cheese was sparse and unmelted the onions were basically nonexistent and the mushrooms were few 
i pulled in with what i thought was tire damage to the side tire wall as it turns out the tire didnt puncture the tire and i appreciated the honesty this is a shop you can trust 
wow this pizza it's really heavy with toppings but very light at the same time super weird then the crust might as well call it bread so fluffy and thick ingredients are very delicious good amount of cheese to topping ratio only complaint is just personal preference lol needs more bacon hahahaha excellent touch with the real bacon cooked perfectly the in-house crumbling makes it feel more like a homemade pizza instead of just over processed bacon-bits other places use totally recommend for family dinner night or ditch the family and enjoy it yourself i won't judge you and neither will the bj's staff lol
flying pie is for sure one of the best pizzas i've ever tasted the crust is just the right amount of dough crisp on the outside and full of flavor i had a mushroom and pineapple and my daughter had a specialty gouda and mozzarella cheese with a variety of toppings we each had our own medium pizza and the total with delivery under 20 
called to replace garage door opener that broke the phone quote was 329 installed once on site the quote became 1027 sent them away lost my business 
maria maria maria i rarely ever give reviews but this is a must i am super picky and specific when it comes to my hair and she has always been patient with me and my ridiculous requests she pays attention to what you want and gives you exactly that not to mention she is very talented she has styled my hair for several events occasions and cut it as well she takes her time and makes sure you are happy with the finished product ask for her you won't regret it 
i believe you were the woman who came in with your husband and son if that was you i would suggest you go some place where your child's screaming doesn't ruin the other diners experience maybe trying to eat out with a young child which can be a very trying experience influenced your attitude i know his high pitched screams didn't help anyone else enjoy their meal just a thought as trying as it may to eat out with a child that doesn't change the overall lack of execution of a simple benedict unless the screaming child distracted the chef for anyone with a experienced palate child or not can taste cold broken hollandaise and poached eggs with a side of chewy french toast as offended as you maybe at a review by a chef because i am a experienced and accomplished chef the attack on my child is petty to say the least considering your cafe wasn't that full and you were closing for i believe was a parade anyway one would like to think you catered to everyone but it just continues to show the type of snobbery you have all because of one dish that one chef liked that happened to get on tv 
the i side is delightful and quaint got some fish here for home grilling and on a whim got the salmon tacos yum the korean salmon tacos are delicious we came back the next week and got some more i can't think of any fish tacos i e enjoyed more 
i really enjoy bab x chicken reno finally has a korean fried chicken place and i hope to see this place thrive their chicken is packed with flavor and is super crunchy i enjoy their side items like the kimchi cole slaw and oden cup which is soup with fish balls i like to order ahead and get lunch there while i'm on my work breaks the chicken also pairs well with the sauces they have i highly recommend people to come i also like that they now offer beer customer service is very good and the workers are very helpful in explaining the menu if you guys are in the area please give this place a try it is true they are not the rice bowl place anymore but the korean friend chicken is unique and i appreciate the diversity it bings the summit 
absolute worst place i've gotten my nails done i decided to give this place not 1 but 2 tries thinking maybe the first time getting a manicure completely wrong was just the result of an employee having a bad day however after going there a second time i realize it wasn't just the one employee my first time getting my nails done at this location was a disaster the woman didn't listen to what i wanted done with my nails from start to finish i told her i wanted my nails more square and she gave me rounded asked her for them shorter and she left them long and crooked i complained when her drill made me bleed on multiple different fingers only for her to get an attitude and basically make me feel like i was in the wrong for telling her her polishing skills were terrible as the french tips i was expecting were very crooked and the white polish was everywhere also the light pink acrylic i wanted was more of a bright hot pink after telling her i knew the pink she was using would come out brighter than what i wanted needless to say 4 months ago i walked out with bare half on shellac'd nails after getting tired of the terrible experience i asked for a soak to get it off which in turn left me with chemicals burning my cuticles and nail beds due to all the drilling to my fingers not to mention the woman didn't care to completely take off the chemicals so i drove home with burning fingers today i go in to use the gift certificate someone got me for my birthday dreading it but hoping this will be a better experience horrible decision i went in for a deluxe pedicure and got a half ass scrub and a polish that was terrible you ever go to a nail salon and get your nails polished and it looks like they decided to relocate your toenails not one of my toenails are painted completely not one and i was left with some sort of oil lubrication on my toes to walk out with as if slipping around in your sandals is ideal it got one star as i don't see an option for 0 i can't even tell my boyfriend about my experience cause then he will feel terrible about his gift if you want my opinion take your money elsewhere cause this location is awful 
i almost don't want to give a good review for this place because i love it so much and don't want it to get too popular but everyone at my nails is an angel and they do an incredible job on my nails i get dip and my nails are so thin and strong and stay looking fantastic for weeks and weeks i love this place 
i've learned after living in texas today there is no way to compare barbecue i really though woody's offered quality meat that had a lot flavor was not dried out and was portioned appropriately my sandwich was huge and the hot bbq sauce was a great addition to it my girlfriend's burger was devoured quickly and we both enjoyed the fries that were great condiment vessels 
slightly above average sushi really only worth going during their 5-7 happy hour you would be disappointed if you were to pay full price for this standard of sushi 
today i actually visited this eatery and i was quite impressed ive never took so long to chose a burger to eat lol quite a selection all in all the food was great as well as service the setting was nice and to be so crowded it wasn't noisy 
this was a place that i really wanted to like tried to like but didn't i ate here after winning a gift certificate at a fundraiser action it is located right in the italian market my wife and i entered through the bar it was a saturday night at about 6 30 and the wait was 45 minutes which it ended up being not a big deal there is a large bar to wait at the atmosphere is pretty cool basically your nice but not too upscale italian place that you would expect in south philly little italy in almost any city or the north end of boston you are seated at a table with cloth table cloth however the menus are paper which is kind of weird the service was fine the food wasn't very good at all i ordered the lasagna i must say that store bought frozen lasagna is better seriously wife ordered some alfredo dish which was mediocre at best before that we had mussels as an appetizer they were so-so as much as it pains me to say this the chain italian restaurants around are actually better also they don't take credit cards i knew this ahead of time however really no credit cards in the year 2014 doesn't get much more trifling than that in the restaurant business i think i have seen food trucks that take credit cards i won't be going back i was so looking forward to some great south philly italian and was let down oh well you win some you lose some and the money spent for the gift certificate went to a good cause 
wifey says this place has yummy italian food the main dishes are all family sized plates we got one order of a creamy pasta and it came in a huge dish we had four people but the plate could have easily fed six the pasta was really good and the pizza looked good here as well also they are awesome homemade tiramisu here too hubby says this place was legit we asked the concierge for the best italian food and checked with yelp and this place came up no disappoints here good atmosphere and good selection of wine apparently it's hard to find a restaurant that serves liquor and wine because liquor licenses are expensive very good place to eat and the pasta was cooked to perfection will definitely go back to this place in the future 
bj's never disappoints their food and service is very consistent their pizza and pasta are my favorites here and of course their famous pazookie i don't like their soups but great choice of beers 
this place is great its sectioned off for big dogs and little dogs and is very clean my dog henry had a great time with a ton of other dogs his size its a little far from my house in comparison to the park located on 11th and lombard but its worth the walk 
although the service was good and the food was tasty there was a serious gnat problem at the restaurant last night after being seated while ordering our party of 6 killed two gnats when the meal arrived they were everywhere two on the napkin one on the wall one on my daughter's tea two flying around my broccoli and finally - the last straw one on my chicken i finally stopped eating after that could not finish i asked for the manager she was appropriately apologetic and took several items off of the bill however the overall graduation celebration dinner was a flop as a result of the gnats will not likely be returning to this location ever 
i only got to go into beehive 2- which is their furniture store across the street have to say i walked in and out in one minute flat thoroughly unimpressed with the furniture selection 
i just want to thank the manager and friendly staff for great customer service we were there from june 16th through 19th the staff always asking you if everything is ok when you walk in to the hotel staff we'll always say hi to you that breakfast was also good the rooms were clean nice and roomy the only thing i notice was the pool needs some work overall it was a good stay
bakery is awesome they sure do know their stuff staff is friendly prices are similar to other supermarkets however recently they're eliminating items-odd 
this park is a continual favorite nice shady boardwalk with an observation tower allows you to see birds plants and wildlife up close the 1 2 mile paved loop is shaded as well and great for walking and biking check out their website for guided hikes there is a playground area as well as open fields for families picnic shelters can be reserved its only a 2 vehicle fee to enter and well worth it 
this review pertains specifically to the wine and beer section of the store there is so much not to like 1 prices are higher then the local beer distributor and pa wine store 2 customer service is consistently awful - upon presenting my purchase to the clerk i said hello there was no response as he waited for the transaction to process he began gnawing on his fingernails right in front of me transaction complete - still no words from the cashier 3 selection is very limited 4 twice the register was unstaffed and i had to ask the deli to have someone paged waited 10 minutes and so while convenience should be one reason to patronize here even this is not guaranteed 
well i can't give this place 3 stars like the other people for a few reasons while this place was nice for the after party it was mainly nice because it was right across the damn hall that is about the only nice thing about it the bartender wasn't that engaging at all apparently he had some problems with josh's champagne and he was not the best at doing the whole you don't have to go home but you can't stay here bit the drinks were decent because we had the special of 3 beers and 5 martinis if we didn't have that i do wonder how much a beer would cost the dive bars i frequent usually have them normally for 3 so i'm thinking it may be closer to 5 for a bud light or something that is nuts but what can you expect from a hotel bar like jane i have no reason to go back i'm positive that the only reason it has 2 5 opposed to 1 5 is because of the awesome yelp community that was in the place without that this place would be pure hell 
i was recommended modify by a friend because ive been trying to turn my blonde brassy color into grey i got there and had a consultation i showed the photo below from pinterest and we started off our appointment with an understanding i thought i had the results i asked for and left happy once i got a few blocks away to sephora since the lighting in the salon is dark i realized all of the roots are yellow in picture i went back and asked them to fix it and they insisted i come back another day i just left eventually the other owner came over and helped reach a solution after being told no from the other i insisted because i was going out of town so waited a few hours for it to finally take only about 30 mins to correct it however now that i'm sitting with the hair color more i'm realizing the roots that were lightened weren't lightened enough and the roots are not a shadow like the picture but a big chunk i wanted to make this place my regular spot but after this no way i wasted 150 i could have just gotten a toner and paid way less 
this was a pretty great place to stay we had an unexpected vacation to the area due to hurricane evacuation and this hotel was so accommodating for the rate we paid we were pleasantly surprised with how spacious clean and accommodating the resort was our room was complete with a kitchen living room bedroom and bathroom the kitchen had all the dishes and supplies we could need the bathroom was spotless and the view onto the inlet and pool was great but most importantly the staff was incredibly kind they were very accommodating and helpful especially in our circumstances the place was also in a great location a publix was just a minute walk away and the beach was right across the street not to mention st petersburg was only a 15 minute drive definitely will stay again thank you 
this place smelled so good driving past that we decided to stop in we were enticed by the free fry offer when you download the app and it ended there the unfriendly cashier helped me to better understand what i was ordering never smiling while 2 other people just stood around watching in the front counter area while waiting for my order i went to the bathroom which was really dirty toilet paper roll just left on the floor when there was a full one in the dispenser ugh - not sanitary sanitation habits of employees has to be the worst here the man in the kitchen making fries was picking his teeth and then touching the fry baskets no- he didn't wash his hands i made eye contact but that didn't dissuade him another guy at the front counter was rubbing his hands on his shirt chest and then proceeded to scoop ice cream when i received my order it was made wrong and the free fries on 3 of our orders were cold stay away unless you want a side of ptomaine poisoning to go response to customer service person hi whitney- i'm going to pass on completing another survey in the burgerfi website just to reiterate what i already detailed above i don't feel there's any benefit to give you my name phone number and email address although you may feel that you have food safety standards in place i would hope they don't include people picking their teeth if it were my restaurant i would have cameras there your staff does not seem to be engage with the customers as the four of us felt like we were inconveniencing your employees this was quite unfortunate because even though the food had potential they didn't no justice by serving it cold and potentially making us sick i wish you well 
my son is a very picky eater so i'm always on the hunt for chicken tenders he will eat i placed a delivery order from finizio of chicken fingers with fries and penne vodka based on yelp's what's good recommendation both dishes were excellent large to make hearty leftovers and my picky eater liked the fingers and managed to eat two food arrived much earlier than yelp grubhub estimated i'll definitely order from them again they may have found a place on my takeout dinner lineup 
items tasted sweet potato pie doberge slice turtle doberge slice rainbow wedding cake doberge slice velvet elvis doberge bite bloody s'mores doberge bite fig and white chocolate doberge bite one of those why didn't someone think of this sooner situations where a simple conversation hatched a business plan that somehow found an audience debbie does doberge is owned by the team of charlotte mcgehee and charles mary their take on new orleans' classic layer cake previously sold only by pre-order now offered by the slice at the couple's bakery bar surely an interesting idea the former dive at 1179 annunciation street just beneath the pontchartrain expressway reinvented as a place for sweets and drinks from before noon until midnight daily bakery bar initially opened as the official point-of-sales for debbie does doberge in april 2016 and now joined by a limited selection of savories the small corner-store has officially caught fire the space nearly 2 3 full at the time of our thursday 4 00pm arrival far more appealing in appearance than the pudding cake from joe gambino's the texture also better with smooth buttercream dividing soft layers as stiffer boiled icing helps each wedge hold its form ms mcgehee follows a modified version of the hungarian dobos torta recipe 'invented' by beulah ledner during the great depression in building her creations a half-dozen or more flavors offered daily by slice or as small pyramidal 'bites' for the indecisive making difficult decisions to maximize variety three slices and a trio of bites shared amongst the group even the most ardent descendent of hungary would be hard-pressed to claim debbie's cakes anything short of excellent the rainbow-themed wedding cake as sweet as it was colorful while the sweet potato pie was completely opposite the heavy southern classic in terms of texture though the flavor was precisely like it having just passed halloween bloody s'mores both cocoa-rich and nicely accented with cinnamon at the same time equally complex pairings were found amidst the peanut butter and banana bite as well as the white chocolate coated figgy pudding the best of the best nonetheless agreed upon by all as the pecan-studded milk-chocolate slice with lightly salted caramel 
i love the food and drink here i come almost every day to get my quiche salad tea and chocolate croissant the only reason for my 4 instead of 5 stars is the offputting interactions i often have at the register the people who take my order are almost always stressed unfriendly rushed don't make eye contact etc odd behavior for the usual santa barbara customer service i've spent 20 plus years encountering which is usually that people i encounter are friendly comfortable with eye contact etc if the restaurant was busy tables full line out the door of course i don't imagine or expect that the cashier would take their time to smile and ask how i am doing but when it's fairly mellow it's hard for me to understand as someone who has worked plenty of customer service why friendliness and welcoming isn't a standard i'll likely keep coming back because i love the food and peach mint iced tea but the cashiers could use some time management or stress management training to allow them to be more welcoming and friendly 
the staff are not kind not smiling seems to not working well under pressure not a pleasant way to start my day
wow wow wow this place is amazing i just ordered take out and it's my first time trying out this place first thing first staff members amazing very welcoming place looked very clean now let's get to the food i ordered a bowl of clam chowder and let me tell you it had lots of clams inside and it was great also ordered the baby lobster pasta you guys need to know that ive never ever had so much lobster in my pasta i was so amazed and also the taste amazing i deft give this restaurant five and more stars i wish i would of came here long ago i didn't know because it's hidden a lil i say best seafood place in brandon please take my word
i have been going to this salon for about 2 years each time i am very satisfied with the color and cut greg is amazing and took great pains to find a color that works for me i get so many compliments on the color of my hair as for the rest of the staff they are great they treat you like and old friend each time you walk in such a relaxing atmosphere that i look forward to my grey coming back well not really so i can get a touch up 
i stayed here a few times before and had no complains but last night we stayed here again and it was terrible bed sheets were dirty bathroom was incredible dirty staff has no clue what they are doing it just seems like nobody wants to be there and dont care about their job the kitchen staff is rude and unprofessional and dirty
exquisite i went with a party of five last thursday night and we are still talking about our meal every flavor was different and delicious - we started with the roti canai and liked it so much we had to order a second and argue over who got to finish off the curry potato leftover dip with some rice the chicken satay was tender and flavorful the homemade tofu satay stuffed with peanuts was deep fried and delectable we also had the mango salad yum beef rendang mouth watering and meat oh so tender pad see ew and chicken fried rice loved the black pepper seasoning and thai basil with that amazing homemade tofu i can't wait to go back and try more dishes and repeat that roti canai 
living in spanish springs there really are no good indie craft beer or cocktail bars that aren't nicotine factories near me at all i came in here last night with a good friend in from san francisco that i hadn't seen in years i was so happy that they only allowed smoking outside the bar manager zack was friendly and helpful in his recommendations it was pretty empty for a while just my friend and i the pineapple blonde i was drinking was ah mazing there is plenty of parking zack joined in with us in our convo and it was seamless it's like we made a new friend the lighting is nice great vibes and we closed the place down i am only giving it 1 4 off for limited seating but the place is small so it's really not their fault and i didn't see the patio ok 5 stars it is will be back soon - 
place is visually stunning plenty of equipment and classes pool are for kids is like a miniature adventure island smaller kids have a great time from a family membership holder it's well worth the money paid kids and parents use the y almost daily 
we love crabby bills this is our families absolute favorite restaurant and whenever we're all in town we make sure to stop by as a vegetarian i'm always thrilled to see their veggie options - including a veggie burger which is often rare to find in this area - though i do wish they had a few more appetizer options for vegetarians seating can also be tricky and there's rarely a table available for our whole family without waiting at least half an hour but with cheap drinks at happy hour we never mind waiting the nachos are awesome and i think the best deal out there - our whole family couldn't even finish them consistently great food and fun atmosphere 
what a wonderful surprise we wandered into this place thinking we would get a bowl of udon and wow terrific staff greeted us warmly and explained how everything worked a fun place to eat with the pots cooking at your table and the conveyor belt of yummy veggies quail eggs mushrooms etc make this a special experience everything from the soup bases and the sauces and meats we chose were just delicious we had the waygu beef buttery and tasty great prices for high quality food wonderful flavors and great staff and atmosphere we can't wait to go back 
fast forward to my second time there they forgot two sandwiches in my to go order had to go all the way back but at least my order was voided out and they threw in some free items for the inconvenience i'm glad this time there were more girls working the take out counter however i did have to prompt them more than once to get my order on the return trip 
terrible customer service - i had to call to get updates on my car no one ever reached out to me then the team member handling my car forgot to have the headlights replaced until the day i was coming to get my car - and only because i specifically asked if it was done before i drove over to pick up it up btw all this last minute rushing to have my car ready was ridiculous considering my car had been sitting there untouched for over a week while they waited for a rocker panel to come in the best part was discovering that my turn signal doesn't work now so i have to bring my car back again the body shop is deplorable i will never recommend them to anyone nor will i bring my car back to payne for any service 
if you're craving brunch but too lazy to leave the confines of your residence this is a good option for brunch delivery after classically spending a significant amount of time trying to find a brunch spot for bae and myself that fit all the stringent necessary criteria vegetarian and low carb options bae decides it was raining and doody outside and thus better to stay in with jammies i had brunchy-eggness on my mind and not ready to give up the idea of a cozy brunch i searched for omelette on caviar and this place came up multiple omelette options that extend beyond boring and standard omelette options there was one with pesto literally mixed into the omelette itself which surrounded tomatoes mozarella and olives i was sold i typed old by accident fml immediately bubba ordered salsa omelette brie salsa and basil with sausage unfortunately caviar took literally forever to come like about an hour there was also an issue of confusion regarding where our residence actually is by the time it arrived our omelettes were ice cold requiring microwaving i thought mine was absolutely delicious and ate the entire thing my fiance was absolutely repulsed by the temperature and subsequent texture of the omelette and could barely stomach eating any of it luckily for this place i am the one writing this review and thus a positive review on second thought our choice to order an omelette for delivery was probably questionable this is a good place to order brunch if you're brave and hopefully have a good caviar delivery person 
this is the best eatery i've been to in clearwater beach the food is great the service is excellent and the location is perfect i've been there twice l first time i tried the baja bowl and i chose grilled shrimp it was so good and you can tasted the shrimp freshness second time i went there i had fish taco and it was amazing the best fish taco i have had and i have been to 4 places around the area nothing like this places's taco 
my bf and i are new yorkers still on the hunt for the perfect slice here in pa benny's is definitely getting closer the sauce is a little sweet and the pie could use a little more time in the oven but we will be ordering from benny's again 
decor and games are great i've enjoyed hanging out here earlier in the evening once it gets late the place is packed to the point that you can't move around or hear anything i'd give the place another star if it weren't for the awful bouncers i get that it isn't a bouncer's job to be super friendly but these guys go out of their way to be a-holes they refused to let my sister in who is not underage because they insisted her id was a fake when she explained that the new maryland license looks different he insisted she was lying repeatedly called her honey and tried to break her license in half i've had other unpleasant interactions with them but this was it for me if you really want to go here and don't have a pa license you should consider bringing your birth certificate passport etc although i can picture these guys still turning you away 
excellent food nice atmosphere not too pricey who doesn't love whiskey wednesdays great place to pick-up a rich old lady - 
this place is certainly the hidden gem of st louis and deserves to be as well-known as ted drewe's or pappy's for better or worse i lived in the apartment building above the restaurant's new location and my roommate and i ate there so many times in its opening weeks that we frequently got complimentary appetizers i've ordered or sampled almost everything on the menu and can confidently say that there's nothing that isn't done to perfection everything is very reasonably priced and the food is carefully and thoughtfully prepared i once went during the opening week while they were a bit understaffed and the cook delivered the food straight to our table sweat still dripping from his brow if that isn't proof that the food is cooked with love i don't know what is the service can sometimes be slow but keep in mind that this is true creole soul-food -- you're not supposed to be in a rush right anything you order will be your new favorite this explains how you can order an i don't know and get a surprise meal from the kitchen and still be satisfied but i think the sandwich section is the best the monte cristo is basically a sandwich made on french toast genius and the bayou billy and special ed were also frequent orders of ours don't miss out on the sides either the sweet fries are so sticky and delicious that you have to eat them with a fork -- the way they should be done everywhere they also serve breakfast all day which is always a tell-tale sign of awesomeness whether you're a local or just a visitor to the area don't miss kitchen sink and ideally go more than once 
just walking distance from the beach great spot for good tacos and as always a really cold beer 
this is a nice gym and i like the fact i can access it 24 7 but after the staff leaving the other patrons are nasty they leave their water bottles and paper towels all over the gym i tend to wipe down the equipment before and after use just in case it was not wiped down before me when staff is there you will see them cleaning the eqipment they are friendly and helpful i have noticed lately the floors need to be cleaned more there is a lot of hair and stuff in between the equipment they offer limited classes so you may need to take those cycling and yoga classes somewhere else the plan is to have more classes added there is also a kid's club for the little ones under 12 the sauna is also available 24 7 you can steam or dry heat in the sauna it gets really hot as long as people are not continuing walking in and out the tanning beds are available during staffed hours this is not something i used overall for the price it a good gym with nice equipment it is a neighborhood gym 
we just tried to get a table and was notified that they were closed for the evening it's 9 23 and posted time of closing is 10pm and we weren't the only group trying to get a table after reading the website we noticed that they do in fact close at 9 however there are no hours posted on the building and all business listings online except for their website say 10pm 
i feel so lucky to live down the road from this fabulous expansive year-round market from fresh produce to local plants to delicious coffee and food - they really have it all here just to show you the diversity of vendors recent purchases include an amazing chocolate croissant local essential oils pickling cucumbers pupusas fresh-brewed local iced tea and artisan goat cheese there is something for everyone here and usually at least one music act to enjoy while you're strolling super pup-friendly too - one of the best parts is checking out all the cute doggos while you scarf your grilled breakfast burrito mountain views lots of parking and super variety get here 
probably the worst experience we have ever had we showed up at 2 25pm with our kids and another friend who also had kids we were told that they take the last seating at 2 30pm before closing at 3pm so we are like okay great we are on time but then we are told we need reservations for a party of 7 while the restaurant was completely empty we asked if that was listed because we never saw it on google or yelp we were told that it's on their website not only we will never go back again but we will also be placing a complaint with better business bureau this was the most ridiculous and unprofessional behavior ever in the restaurant industry i believe it was the owner chef we were speaking to and she kept saying we are a small restaurant and need reservations at 2 30pm you need reservations when the place is empty skip it 
i went to this gym for a seminar they hosted with clinical athlete nevada pt and engage movement the gym is beautiful and spacious usually at other gyms they have low ceilings and that stuffy feeling but not this one high ceilings lots of space to do any kind of workout this gym is more for crossfit type of exercises as there more focus on space for lifts and other various activities you want to try lead by wonderful ladies with friendly staff plenty of bars and racks for your powerlifting needs beware - single use restrooms for the lady and the gentleman parking - decently located there are some spaces reserved solely for the gym and free spots further down in case there aren't anymore in front of the gym 
we've been going to accent on vision for at least a decade the doctors are great the receptionists are incompetent they are so incompetent that my husband and i are looking for a new optometrist they completely screwed up our appointments then claimed they could squeeze us in later but then started back peddling on that with as difficult as scheduling an appointment is and the distance we have to drive we will not return 
50 cent oysters monday-thursday 3-6 pm all you need to know about red fish grill the oysters were fat and juicier than any i've had in miami and a steal at 6 a dozen we also tried the bbq oyster po'boy and it was alright i had a lemon drop cocktail for 7 at happy hour and it was also decent but not spectacular the service was slow for 4 pm and sitting at the bar but perhaps it's because several orders of oysters were placed ahead of mine the bartenders were also not very inviting and seemed somewhat standoffish when interacting with us not sure that i'd come here for an actual sit-down meal given the happy hour prices 
adam is a very talented massage therapist it's obvious he enjoys helping people relax i have been getting massages for more than 20 years and his was the best he's thorough and knows how to keep consistent pressure you will not be disappointed 
first off i'm a vegetarian so the options for me are incredibly limited which is something i'm used to being from a non-veggie family they did have a grilled cheese which they were happy to put onions and tomato on for me but like so many grilled cheeses the bread was very greasy fries were yummy waitstaff was really nice and i liked the look of the place everyone i was with got the fish and chips and they really liked it 
my family has been here a number of times when the craving for crab just can't wait our most recent visit was on a friday night around 5pm and the place was filled with atmosphere and just overall lively vibes we were quickly seated and our server cynthia promptly set about to pick our brains as to what would best suit us from the menu she has a wonderfully upbeat professional and intuitive quality that made her a perfect example of what i consider a top-notch server cynthia took a seat at our table and hooked us up with an excellent enjoyable meal she was very thorough listened well and delivered just the right amount of attention my mother and i had king crab with a trifecta sauce a delectable blend of spices garlic and butter that permeates the crab we also ordered some breaded scallops which i have to say were hands down the best scallops i've ever eaten - that coming from an avid scallop lover thanks to cynthia's suggestion we ordered corn on the cob and small red potatoes that were thrown into the crab 'bags' a nice addition to dunk into the trifecta sauce the drink we chose was hurricane a delicious alcohol drink served in very quaint canning jars overall i was very impressed it does end up being a bit pricey but so well worth it for an occasional treat 
came here for happy hour with my girlfriend we sat at the bar which was pretty packed the service was awful it took forever for someone to even greet us and even longer for them to take our order i noticed that everyone else at the bar was being serviced so i felt i was being racially profiled the food was good but contaminated because two days after both my friend and i ended up with food poisoning hers worse than mines as she ended up in the er i wish i could get my money back and have gotten the bar staffs names because i don't like how we was treated while dining just an update on this problem i immediately emailed ruth chris after they responded to this post and months later no one has reached out to me kinda feel like they just reached out because of the bad review and wanted to show face i'm disappointed once again in how they handled things 
ordered online the restaurant emailed me back saying my order was received when i went to pick it up they told me they never received the order i showed them the email they sent me confirming my order they refused to honor my order or their confirmation of my order if this restaurant can not get its act together and accept online orders they should close 
maybe i should write two reviews--one for vet services and one for grooming we are new to the area and have used the vet services no complaints good service due to scheduling i have actually been referred over to the dove mountain location twice i had my yorkie groomed there for the first time a few weeks ago i was kind of shocked by how terrible he looked when we picked him up it's possible that the horrible outcomes were a result of a flawed system or just bad luck giving the benefit of a doubt when i dropped him off the front desk person explained that the groomer was busy so i should just tell her what i wanted i had never paid for grooming services without speaking to the groomer i did by best to convey what i wanted his body hair was already on the shorter side so i asked for his face and sanitary areas to be well-groomed and the rest touched up when i picked him up i could tell the only thing that had even been touched was his head i told the groomer that i could tell his behind hadn't even been touched so she took him back and quickly cleaned that area up with the clippers honestly i am used to picking him up from his old groomers in different state looking great this time i walked out and couldn't believe i spent all that money on such a horrible job so i will continue using the vet services but will not use the grooming services again i will also make sure that i always have the opportunity to speak directly to the groomer prior to service 
attempted the restaurant twice already hoping the second visit would improve so why two stars during the first visit my friend ordered a house cab that had little flavor it makes for a good grape juice i had the lemon drop martini and it tasted watered down the caprese salad was the best food item appetizer on the menu as it comes stacked with the added touch of a few fried green tomatoe slices the seafood pasta has a wonderful homemade spicy marinara sauce but the shrimp had a slight smell and the mussels were so tiny went back with family and unfortunately the dishes were not impressive the chicken caprese sandwich was dry and tough the eggplant parmesan sandwich was sliced so thin the vegetable took a form similar to shoe leather this sandwich was barely touched and we made a remark to the server but it was missed i went with the chicken parmesan and the meat was clearly over-fried when served with black edges the pasta that comes with the chicken was good with plenty of sauce i live in this community and have wished park square would provide a family friendly quality restaurant for a really long time so unless the kitchen pays close attention to their customer feedback and willing to make changes then i don't see this place lasting but a few months 
i was looking for a clean quiet friendly small place to stay for a nice i found this little jewel now it isn't a westin but it does have all the things you require to sleep well it was a comfortable and clean bed the shower was hot and plentiful there was an iron a small table hairdryer microwave coffee and little refrig all for a weekday price of 99 00 i couldn't find anything under 150 00 my friends were across the street and they paid much more for a place that wasn't as friendly or clean i love the manager owner jennie she will make sure you have everything you need it's not just about how fancy a place is it's about getting the best experience for the buck 
unfortunately this is my neighborhood shoprite and i really like their prices but the staff is truly unfriendly to minorities which leads me to travel to the arimingo store plus parking is a nightmare and carts cannot leave the store get it together people it's 2012 
ok i just have 2 words about this cashier fire nieemah record breaking customer horrible attitude horrible i asked for assistance she rolled her eyes i was not able to get my cash back immediately due to machine defect her response i'm waiting for manager what do you want me 2 do well what you should have done was seek to find someone to assist me instead you chose to stand in front of store and say welllll i dont see her so you gotta wait really ok does it truly matter her mother works in deli that young lady should be escorted and banned from working with human society until she is properly trained to do so 
i cannot begin to say enough about this awesome hyatt location i'm not only a world of hyatt member but also anytime share holder due to a medical emergency i flew to texas to be with my mom the rest of my family sister nieces daughter and grandsons drove with all the items they need for my grandbabies it was easier than flying they left california late and were getting sleepy right about tucson although their plan was to drive straight through it was too dangerous with the children i called hyatt tucson and spoke to julia at 2am i told her i needed to book a room for my family and wondered if she could help me with their 230am check in she was absolutely wonderful and welcomed them gave them water and accommodated them with sunroom that had a bed for everyone my family continued their journey with enough rest to get them to texas safely i continue to praise hyatt for their kindness and for the excellent staff they continue to employ i will recommend hyatt to everyone i know especially they tucson hyatt and of course julia thanks julia 
this place is amazing the food and pastries are very good and the service was wonderful as well every employee was kind and attentive 
this place is a hidden gem the food is absolutely amazing and the staff takes service to the next level by making sure every guest is taken care of diana is the reason i will return because she knows how to entertain her guests the ownership is awesome as well 
we have never had flying pie pizza it was delicious we ordered two small pizzas and were able to get two meals out of them the crust is nice and more traditional the toppings were fresh and tasty we will absolutely eat here again 
they are on top of it they have tables and booths 6 feet apart they have a call list if they can't seat you right away they are super friendly attentive and on point i didn't realize they moved but luckily my guest knew the place is small but has an open feel to it every thing is clean that's just the establishment now for the food my guest ordered the ultimate home fries and they were ultimate the biscuits are huge huge helping of potatoes and gravy yum yum i ordered the santa fe benedict the chorizo was spicy and so was the hollandaise sauce the english muffin was soft and the eggs were perfect hands down my favorite item on the menu 
good pizza but having a bar in a separate part of the building is inconvenient not sure why they did that but i'll buy more pizza there to go 
i've always been a fan of victory beers are fantastic food is good nachos used to be the best around hot real cheese ample portion new recipe not so great bring back the pub nachos that came out hot double the price call them something else just bring them back 
simply put amazing food is excellent i could write 500 words but this is all you need to know be prepared for a wait especially for breakfast but it'll be well worth it 
i love everything about korean food and took a friend here to share the experience i specifically told the waitress we wanted barbecue on the grill and she said she understood i pointed to the dishes we wanted on the menu and again made it clear by pointing to the grill right there that we wanted to cook it on the grill she brought us 4 little dishes of side vegetables half of what i get when i am there with my korean friend i had to ask for lettuce and gochichang that is always automatically served she came with 2 plates of previously over cooked mealy meat morsels and wouldn't take them back should've left right then won't be back 
we dined at papa's last week for dinner the fried oysters soft shell crab fried catfish huge portions gumbo and pasta with shrimp were all up to new orlean's standards but then i heard papa was displaced by katrina so glad his place is doing well we will be back the next time we are in middle tn sat at a shared table with a nice couple from pa 
i used to frequent little caesar's quite frequently just because of sheer laziness and needing something hot and ready the last three times i went to this location there have been literally zero pizzas hot and ready and the estimated time to wait is at least ten minutes what how it's pizza even before the pizzas were being delayed they were consistently inconsistent going in there i would have to make a random guess as to whether i'm going to get a totally f cked up pizza or a mildly adequate one all in all i'm actually really glad that the service here took such a dive into the sh tter because now i that i never go there i am healthier and more motivated to cook my own good food or go elsewhere - someplace that serves food my dog would eat 
such an awesome venue my first time at the union transfer was 3 years ago for yelp's backstage pass event and while it served as a great place for that function i was quite eager to return for a concert luckily when the new pornographers announced they would be performing there this past july i was delighted to discover that there were still tickets available the day of the show after assisting some friends with a video shoot i hopped on the 23 bus down 11th street and headed straight for the box office i bought two tickets one for myself and one for my friend who attended the concert with me and i didn't even have to pay a surcharge hence why i preferred to purchase tickets at the box office rather than online by the time we arrived back at the union transfer after a quick trip to chinatown for some food the venue was pretty packed but we managed to find a spot behind the barrier between the bar area and the main floor the opener for this show was the san francisco based thao and the get down stay down and while i wasn't nearly as familiar with their music i was very impressed and i recognized the song they closed their set with when the new pornographers came on stage i was disappointed to see that neko case wasn't performing with them however simi stone who was there in neko's place was fantastic and did neko justice and they played many of my favorites the sound quality far outweighed other venues where i've seen shows and once the crowd on the main floor started to clear out we made our way closer to the stage looking forward to the next concert i attend here whatever it may be 
the nacho dish is excellent and could not be better food is fresh and of high quality the plant based cheese tastes like real dairy cheese spouse also raved about the food and how delicious it was

loved the decor and ambiance of this new old city bar restaurant it was busy but not packed and on the night we were there they had the doors and windrows open allowing the place to feels like extension of the city streets we had just stopped in to grab a drink and settled on a lychee martini and a margarita with hibiscus infused tequila both drinks were made quickly and were slightly too sweet and sour couldn't taste any alcohol in them they weren't something i'd order again but they weren't bad either they had plenty of tvs with hockey and baseball on but they weren't preventing some of the couples in the restaurant from having an intimate date night overall i'd definitely come back and try the food from what i saw and smelled coming out of the kitchen the food is probably tasty i'll be back with an update soon 
delicious vegan soul-food it's nearly always empty which always makes me worry we'll lose this great place bring a bottle for byo and settle in for some killer veg bbq the ultimate vegetarian comfort food veggie loaf or perfect black-eyed peas even my carnivore husband can find good food to eat here you won't believe the mini crab-cake appetizers don't actually have crab in them 
can you have a bad meal here i doubt it consistently delicious and straight up home cooking they make you feel like family because that's who's cooking your food and taking care of you i have been several times and was always happy something as simple as the chicken platter was cooked to perfection and a highlight do yourself a favor and visit soon you'll be part of the family too 
with all the pizza places in riverside-delran area 11 total this bakery has the best damn tomato pies around just like my grandmom's was olive oil bottom crispy crust tangy sauce not to puffed up cooked to perfection i just wish they put some snapple tea in the fridge to sell with the slices it's hard to resist eating them before i get home 
i saw 58 hundred as a new and hot restaurant here on yelp and it was in near my neighborhood so i decided to give it a go a couple weeks ago there was a pretty long wait for the main dining section but we were able to get a table in the bar area within just a few minutes which was nice the concept is very good--a play on the butcher shop and the garden with both meat-centric and vegetarians options i was with a friend and we decided we would just split everything we could try a couple of things we settled on the black pepper biscuits with apple butter and cheese which were on special brussel sprout tacos and braised beef and gnocchi i've posted photos of each if you're interested in checking them out the beef is only a half potion in the photo let's start with the biscuits they were quite good and you could tell they had been made in house they had a nice crisp outside which is always good on a biscuit the apple butter was awesome and the cheese they served with it was very good as well the brussel sprout tacos come as a pair i like brussel sprouts but had never had them served this way they were very good flavorful and to my surprise quite satisfying as a stand alone dish they are on the appetizer menu i believe i would have enjoyed them and and appetizer or side as a main course the braised beef and gnocchi was good i've had some pretty good pot roast and that is essentially what the braised beef was it wasn't immaculate but it wasn't disappointing the gnocchi however was very good and i'm glad i got it i only had half a portion but it was not a super big serving even seeing the other half of the dish across the table from me on my friend's plate you would probably want something as a starter if you are going to order this dish the service was very good and the serve brought out the entree on two dishes already split in half without us even having to ask which i thought was a thoughtful touch to an overall great experience i'll definitely be back in the future 
mercedes-benz of tampa made the car buying process painless i love my cla 250 each piece of the process was simple and smooth from beginning to end i highly recommend mercedes-benz of tampa 
i left the honda dealer who i had purchased car from to come to clark's auto because they offered to go the extra mile and try and help me with an issue i was facing at the time after the issue was taken car of i continued going to them - after 10 years of driving my civic i was ready for a new car one of the owners went out of their way to contact another customer of theirs who was looking for a civic everyone won - i got more than a trade in and the other customer got a very loved used civic with a great service record i recommend clark's auto to all my friends and family because bottom line i trust them 
i've been going to sherlock holmes pub for many years and i've noticed they've amped up their menu i just ordered the taco salad and my husband had the chicken mushroom swiss burger with a side of soup for lunch and the food was so amazing we actually went back later in the day for dinner we shared spring rolls and chicken strips with fries and once again it was so delicious i love listening to the one man band and always have such an amazing time we've yet to have bad service - the servers are always on it and working their butts off definitely my first choice for a night out 
the food and service was amazing ricardo our server was a true rock star we will be back and ask for him thank you ricardo and the rest of the amazing top notch staff
this place was amazing we were able to be seated here with no way on a friday night our server guy was fantastic and gave us lots of suggestions about what items we should order we started off with some wonderful alcoholic drinks that were very strong we also decided to get the crawfish and alligator fries which was my favorite dish of the night i got a poboy that had shrimp and crawfish on it which i loved cause the seafood was seasoned and cooked so good and tender other items i sampled from other people at the table include jambalaya crab cakes and fried shrimp and they all tasted great our server even convinced us to get some drinks to go gotta love new orleans for that 
i am a frequent traveler including many trips to indianapolis this hotel has very nice rooms and excellent service the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the floor plan my room was a triangle - spacious bit with a lot of useless space the lobby had no plan start or finish - more like walking thru a mall than being in a hotel as such i wasn't sure what was part of the hotel and what wasn't not terrible but not great either the only part i really didn't like was the parking it requires tight turns to get into and to maneuver around once inside it also is not associated with the hotel so you have to pay everytime you go in and out rather than being added to the hotel bill also the parking elevator only services the parking garage so a long walk is required to get to the hotel elevator 
absolutely awesome my first time visiting montecito lets be honest i just went so i could feel like oprah this place was a perfect brunch spot veggie egg whites were fresh and flavorful while still be super healthy husband's blta was bananas and just felt like the kind of blt you would get from the four seasons or something aint no microwaved bacon in oprah-land thats for sure oh wait- my small cappuccino was huge and one of the best i've ever had don't even get me started on the pastries shiiiiit go here asap 
avon indiana has just been blessed with an amazing indian restaurant we moved here three years ago and had not found any decent indian food on this side of indy the moment i saw they were open for business i stopped in not realizing that they had just closed at 3pm for their dinner they served me anyway to sample the food and get a togo menu i only order the vegi samosa's with chutneys since it was a very late lunch i can't wait to go back and sample more of the menu and their buffet the restaurant decor is also very nice it is definitely an all occasion kind of restaurant 
i've had food from goombas many times this place hands down has got the best sandwiches around the ingredients are not only fresh and top of the line but the amount that's packed into each roll is enough to make each a meal for 2 you want a good meatball this place is for you get one of their monstrosity size 30 pizzas and you'll feed a small village this guy has definitely brought south philly to da burbs i don't know of any other place within an hours ride that uses the aged provolone like they have here do yourself a favor just give it a try once you will be hooked
walk-in on a calm saturday noon for a gel mani and regular pedi and brow wax left 1 5 hours later i didn't post pics of the pedi since they were worse than the mani and you can imagine what that would look like she skipped using the cuticle pusher forgoed laying a towel on the work table despite my request to please do so i also didn't post pics of the brow wax since i ended up doing most of it myself with her tweezer and wax stick because the technician did not understand what i was saying to her and altogether skipped the underside and side of the brows judge the results for yourself 47 total exclusive of a 32 tip 
great great food and very pleasant service even though it took some time i wish i could eat here every day had i the time and proximity 
they are the most honest fair and personable auto mechanics i've ever taken my car to i will recommend them all the time from now on i finally learned a lesson that i've been told about for years about the service dept at my current car dealer but i never believed until my last time my car needed work 
excellent sandwiches and salads we highly recommend the chinese chicken salad and any of the 2 meat sandwiches 
always interesting place today we each chose the non dairy - but were not fans of the chocolate flavor perhaps they could give other non dairy options a try other than coconut 
80 per night with priceline's name your price figured i would share my stay is from may 24 to may 26 and i booked today may 22 i will update my review once i've stayed but i am already happy 
went to restaurant 830 teusday morning place not busy snowed overnight noone shovel snow at front entrance place is big got seated notice place has seating outside only mention this because there is garbage all over place in outside seating area ordered breakfast bacon and eggs hashbrowns are disgusting dry old proably deep fried told server their gross she brings hashbrowns cakes unappealing deep fried again don't understand appeal of this place cheap prices mediocre food you get what you pay for won't return
for the pizza i'd give it 3 stars but overall when i factor in free stuff and prices it deserves 4 stars i mean the pizza isn't as good as other area sit-down places like jolly ollies or ny pie but it's pretty good and a great deal it's just as good as the fast food pizza joints wrapped up with the pizza which is assembled in front of you are cooking instructions and a survey you can complete after completing the short phone survey you write down the code you're given and you get to choose one of 4 menu items on your next visit free stuff is good we usually choose the cheesebread or the cookie dough although you don't get much with the cookie dough the cheesebread and marinara is great as good as any other i've had anywhere we really liked their 1-topping 5 faves but recently they increased the price to 6 except on fridays one advantage of baking your own pizza is getting the crust exactly how you want it the pizza comes with a disposable baking sheet that works fine i like to take the pizza off the sheet when it has a minute or two left to get the crust nice and crispy papa murphy's is a nice change when you don't want to spend much on pizza 
finallllllllly i have found a sushi restaurant that i really really like i ordered the sashimi platter and it was so fresh and delicious i ordered two rolls too and they were okay they were a little on the dinky side in terms of how large the fish portions were in the roll but the sashimi was so good that i really didn't care you also get free miso soup edamame and orange slices which added a very nice touch the service was also very good our waitress was really cool and took care of us well 
tacos el rodeo aka the fun truck in front of sherwin williams on washington ave makes your belly happy great food for a great price get the tacos - one chicken one beef best tacos in philly 
i yelped vegan reno and found this dive so divine i dined here twice good places deserve your dollar the staff was thoughtful and exceptional in offering vegan suggestions veg restaurants are hard to come by so having variety makes ordering a chore they've got a creative and colorful use of space try the nachos and the soup du jour don't forget dessert 
i love this place salad was fresh and the chicken salad was delicious and the potato soup was absolutely delicious the service was great 
we used wags and wiggles when we went out of town for 12 days and have nothing but great things to say we have two dogs that were very well taken care of the walker came twice a day and our dogs were happy to see us when we got home we had a detailed report waiting for us i got text messages with photos while on vacation i gave my consent to them doing that and there were no unpleasant surprises when we got home we will use again in the future and i would recommend to anyone who wants a dog walker so much less stress on us and the dogs than boarding them and it was nice to know that our apartment was being looked after 
lunch at the buffet good variety but most dishes way too salty good service especially from the man behind the dessert counter i was having a coughing fit from hay fever and he brought me a glass of icy water just what i needed 
they have a really good chocolate mousse cookie it's a cookie topped with cream and chocolate mousse dipped in chocolate i love the mousse and the crunch the dipped chocolate gave it the eclair was good standard i was most looking forward to the strawberry tart which i found sadly lacking the tart wasn't very good i think it needs to be changed 
here for the weekend decided to try it and they truly do live up to the ny style pizza excellent pizza my husband tried the chicken bacon ranch and meat lovers i had the white pepperoni good stuff 
i honestly didn't find barb and ernie's to be anything special their eggs bennie were overpriced and not that tasty when it comes to brunch in edmonton you have so many options i would recommend taking your brunch dollars elsewhere 
we went shopping for a new vw back in the spring of 2015 found one we might be interested in and were in the process of discussing price and trade in value on our old car our salesman was a nice polite gentleman when we got to the sales manager however it was a different story he was an asshole plain and simple and i informed him of this and we walked maybe he makes lots of money for the dealer and that's why they keep him on but if i owned the company i would definitely find managers who can handle people in a professional manner and not act like a three year throwing a tantrum over a loaded diaper no wonder the average shopper hates going to a car dealer for anything at all and will do anything at all to avoid them 
this coffee shop is so cute they have a great selection of coffee and pastries it's probably some of the best coffee i've had in new orleans i also have gotten their biscuit sandwich which i also found very tasty they have a lot of indoor and outdoor seating which makes it a great place to catch up with friends get some work done or just do some reading the only problem is that they limit the wifi to an hour and don't have any outlets so definitely don't recommend this place if you need to dedicate hours to getting work done i've never had any problems with street parking and the staff has always been very friendly definitely recommend 
two stars only because the updated apartments are super nice most of the maintenance techs are great if you flag them down your self they are polite and fix the issue at hand how ever the office is a total disaster they never repay service calls on time they aren't knowledgeable about the apartments they rent there just sales people and last but not least parking is awful for 1300 a month you think i would have a parking spot but nope we all share with vehicles and trailers which aren't aloud fyi but dare you curb park or on the grass or handicap spot you will be towed that night with no empathy been here 26 months absolutely cannot wait to leave 
the drive thru is fast but inside is slow as hell even when it's empty food is decent just like most other fast food chains 
paul brombal not only is a coin dealer and carries estate jewelry but you can purchase international currencies from him if you take a trip overseas however beware the very poor customer service and unfriendly clerks and the owner himself i purchased some unusual foreign currency on monday and learned on thursday that portion of my trip had been canceled due to unsafe conditions in that area i immediately returned to paul and asked for my original money back he not only refused to give me my full refund but he essentially told me to leave and go deal with a bank he said he was in business to make a profit and not do good customer service i was appalled that i would be treated so rudely and i will never give him my business again for any reason if i could give-5 stars i would 
the response by the owner is completely false i do believe they think i'm someone else i am kicking myself for not reporting this place sooner it is clear that i am one of many that had really bad experiences here very disappointed that i waited as long as i did to remove my child 
worst most embarrassing experience in recent memory we booked here for a nice dinner out to celebrate a bachelor party and the food was horrible what steakhouse does not have steaks service was slow even for southern standards and just over salted horrible experience 3 8 2020 reservations early dinner 
bret's did a great job handling all customers and ensuring everyone was acknowledged and then taken care of thank you 
this place is just okay i read the reviews and decided to take a co-worker here for their last day with the company and i wish i hadn't just generic okay food service was fine though they certainly aren't giving anything away expensive food small portions and it's not worth what you pay for it the ambiance is non existent and the menu is not impressive perhaps hearing how good it was before going was the kiss of death as i was not impressed and neither of the young ladies that i dines with were either you could spend much less for food that is just as good or better i'm not going there to simply keep them in business 
i highly recommend the team at larry miller vw from start to finish we were treated exceptionally well i would highly recommend james freibert for all of your sales leasing needs thank you 
great surprise with amazing flavors we tried the chicken shawarma and falafel sandwiches pita bread as well as the greek fries the green garlic spicy sauce was through the roof with flavor we will definitely be back 
got some good to go and it wasn't that good chicken in my enchilada was dry and had no flavor the chorizo bean dip was gross tried it won't be back 
i heard about this company from my neighbors on nextdoor com i also checked out their yelp reviews after their guy repaired my dryer i'm happy to recommend them they called me back quickly after i left a voice mail and they were flexible with me when i needed to reschedule the repair guy forgot to get his name showed up on time and worked quickly he knew exactly what the problem was and showed me the parts that were worn out best of all he had the new parts on hand to repair my dryer in one visit i'll definitely call them again if i need another appliance repair 
the worst sushi restaurant experience i've had in new orleans for starters i was given clear soup with noodles and soy sauce as broth then i ordered shrimp shumai which were not cooked fully after sending it back what i received was nothing short of a ball of dough half cooked shrimp were literally halfway falling out and did the entree the sexiest man roll had the worst snow crab i've ever had i hate writing negative reviews really but this has to be published considering the restaurant was empty of customers at 730 pm on a busy night for dinner i suppose i'm not the only one veggie tempura was the only thing i could finish please be warned 
when we stopped in at the local dairy queen for lunch we saw the sign for the drunken clam and knew that we had to give them a try so we stopped in that evening for dinner as others have said this is a 100 local dive bar but the food is great the chicken ultimate nachos were very good even though the cheese tasted like it was straight out of the same can they use at the ballpark i got the drunken clam burger and she got the cajun wings both were very good the burger was greasy and messy and delicious 
highly recommended--especially if you can get there before 7pm when the happy hour dining specials end the deviled eggs and bologna sandwich were excellent just sit at the bar that's what i did very friendly and knowledgable staff they have an incredible jefferson reserve bourbon there that is fantastic 
my fianc and i love it here a lovely cafe to hang out with a book or laptop or friends always clean amazing baked treats and yummy exclusive blend coffee 
this place is clean always packed on the weekends and the food is consistently good i usually stay away from the shellfish which there is always a lot of but the other dishes are quite tasty the sushi is just ok but definitely not bad at all you get a lot of value for 11 99 per person which keeps my wife and i coming back at least once every two - three months 
i kinda loved this place a few friends decided to come out on a saturday afternoon for a few cocktails and yes we made the right decision margaritas by the pitcher just make sense when we arrived it was already packed at 3 pm so we put our name on the list anticipating a long wait we took our seat at the bar and happily waited it out with drinks in hand the hostess sent a text message when our table was ready and we then proceeded to feast everything was tasty and the service was on point the atmosphere is hip and it's a great gathering point for friends definitely not the cheapest place to eat but worth the experience 
this place is very convenient as i live only a few blocks away also they are one of the only places in the city that actually has a machine and does the work on premises which is why they can have everything ready next day they recently bailed me out and had my shirts cleaned same day actually i lost a bunch of weight over the summer and got all my pants taken in and shortened at reasonable prices i also appreciate the customer service and they completely understand when someone is double parked and just needs to drop off clothes best dry cleaners ever 
this is my favorite takeout place the chicken shawarma with the garlic sauce is amazing bread is yummy too we tried the dessert this time but it was sadly stale 
after a long drive towards home from sarasota i needed to stop some place before i made my way to a showing of rhps i noticed that chick-fil-a was still open and i was happy i pulled in the service was quick it was polite and efficient i placed my order the people at the window got it right and i was out of there in less than 5 minutes the food was right - which is unusual for a drive thru 
just came back from a trip where we rented an rv from roadrunner rv rental awesome friendly and accommodating great prices and wonderful rv we will be back 
steve epstein is the only realtor i trust in santa barbara smart hard working and really good at his job you want this man in your corner buying or selling a home 
if you like weird train wrecks of flavors in your ice cream sriracha pizza vinegar black pepper then you'll probably love little baby's if you aren't into that and want the option of more familiarly-flavored ice cream you're probably out of luck because they typically only have a tiny selection of four to five combinations of flavors that are interesting but just don't taste good they do have more vegan options than any other ice cream place i've been to in philadelphia which is great for vegans the quality of their base ice cream is quite good i've just never before been to an ice cream place where i looked at the menu confused tried one flavor and then left without purchasing any ice cream i encourage creativity but their tiny menu and the fact that they never seem to have any flavors i even want to try has turned me off from getting ice cream there again just add some more palatable flavors to the menu 
i was walking on the street and saw this place looked it up on yelp and it had ok reviews i ordered the poke bowl which tasted very good but for 13 it was very small also got the nachos but they were only ok tortilla chips were kinda soggy the service was good her name was lila 
i have 1 complaint i ate too much the owners were so friendly the banana split was d e l i c i o u s and huge so if you are going to go here and you should either eat a small meal before you go or no meal or order something smaller than the banana split i'm sure anything there would be great may i just add how cool it is that they have a vintage candy shop i saw candy there that i hadn't seen since i was a child and that was a long time ago 
went for lunch what a pleasant surprise food was excellent the best choder i have ever had and that compliment is sincere can't wait to be a regular 
a nice place to pop in for a reasonably priced breakfast 
by far this was our favorite meal in nashville and the perfect capstone to our trip - it was a complete oversight that i failed to write a review at the time but i recently was talking to another nashville visitor who also felt r d was her best meal in sum everything was fresh and well-prepared and the service was excellent without being pretentious don't miss this place 
i have never had bad service at the apple store back when i got my first imac white g5 they went out of their way to put in my memory upgrade while i ate lunch saving me a trip all the way back from murfreesboro then 30 minutes after i got it home the power supply blew up i called in they said just bring it back down i went straight away though the store was wall to wall people they swapped me over to a new imac in 10 minutes upgraded memory and all it has run fine in the years since i have gone back to the apple store for all new apple branded purchases and never had bad service or disappointment most recently the friday before labor day i dropped my 3gs iphone on my kitchen tile and shattered the screen i went online and reserved a 345pm slot for the next day it took maybe 20 minutes total once my turn came to get the entire display changed out sure it was 200 but it was damage from my own fault still name another place you can get such a critical part of an expensive smart phone replaced while you wait and get right back out it has worked great since and looked like new 
i must admit when im in the market for some new literature coles is not exactly the first place that comes to my mind but i was in the mall tonight doing some christmas shopping and thought i would pop in it's alot smaller then it's bigger brothers indigo and chapters but small doesn't necessarily mean bad they still have a good range of best sellers kids books magazines journals and gift items the customer service was also top notch tonight they had both registers manned to deal with the hordes of black friday shoppers but there were still two people out on the floor to help customers i literally got greeted and offered assistance within my first two minutes of being in the store it's clean bright and easy to find your way around in this coles if you don't mind shopping chain stores and happen to be downtown anyways you could do alot worse then stopping in here for your reading needs 
i hate to give target such a mediocre rating however i have never had a pleasant experience with a staff member they hardly make eye contact they are relatively clueless about store items and they have been just plain rude on my last 3 visits i am a nice and easy-going person so i never raise an eyebrow or mention this to a store manager but if it continues i may have to bring it to their attention even though the personnel interaction is poor at this location it doesn't slow me down from going i like target and there is nothing wrong with the store itself they have recently done some interior design updates and it now has a small grocery section 
one word wow the food is so fresh and delicious the waiter an asian man is so friendly and great at manning the place on himself 
incredible food brussel sprouts cheese board all of it patio outside is perfect for evening of wine and food 
i was looking for a paint store that would be near my job and found sherwin williams i had booked a contractor to paint a classroom but realized i wanted to be the one to pick the perfect color fyi this location is a commercial paint store not a cutesy boutique paint store so keep that in mind if you plan to visit when i arrived there were a few contractor guys hanging around the entrance talking about their projects one of them was an employee and he immediately greeted me and walked in the store with me i was able to view the color swatches and ask pertinent questions and the salesperson was very accommodating knowledgeable and pleasant throughout my visit i was more than satisfied with the service and products with all the hassle of scheduling contractors to attend to various aspects of my classroom revamping my experience at sherwin williams was a breath of fresh air 
great rates and helpful staff it was my second day in new orleans and they helped point me in the direction of an area to bike that wasn't too clogged with cars or tourists i'll definitely be back to rent a bike and go up to city park before i leave 
my regular spot for thai i'm spoiled by the great consistency of the food and service here and can never bring myself to go elsewhere in town the only better thai i've had in my life was in paris so as far as the local scene goes this is as good as it gets lunch here is a steal for about 8 you get a full meal soup salad a spring roll and a good sized entree you won't leave hungry and you'll probably take some with you the dinner menu is more extensive with a full section devoted to seafood this is in addition to your appetizers salads and soups noodle dishes and curries with chicken beef pork tofu and all veggie options my favorites are the yellow curry with chicken - medium is a great heat for this dish as it is sweet from the coconut milk base pad thai - get this hot its amazing and has nice even mix of ingredients - you don't get overpowered with egg or tofu and your meat portion will be healthy the garlic pepper entree is wonderful but i'd recommend skipping this if you aren't a big garlic fan last night we got take-out for new years as always our food was ready lickety split in 20 minutes we got vegetarian spring rolls yellow curry with chicken and the pad ped with beef bamboo shoots green beans bell peppers and basil medium was plenty spicy and we easily had leftovers despite the fact it was all going down quickly with the help of a beautiful bottle of sparkling domaine carneros rose our take out order ran us 32 which we gladly paid if you've never tried this place do so you won't regret it 
one week since my parting with home food really nice to taste the sangkee the roasted duck is really great 
today i took my dogs in to have their nails clipped my 12 pound puppy is very skiddish i suggested someone hold her while someone else clipped her nails the girl who took her in the back could tell she was freaked out but wouldn't even pick her up to comfort her i could hear her crying in the back they came out and asked me to muzzle her apparently no one listened to me or wanted to make my one year old puppy comfortable they came back out and said they couldnt do it they said she was flipping around the table when i was getting my refund issued another worker came out and said to put the reason down as dog aggressive i then said she's not agressive and she came back with well she bites it hurt my feelings that they werent willing to be sympathetic to my scared puppy i know that she is not the most challenging dog they've dealt with 
food is delicious and authentic the service was prompt and very friendly the dining area is clean and well kept the food came out quickly and was hot level 3 on spice was just right 
great italian restaurant i had chilean sea bass and it was one of the most amazing things i have ever tasted i highly recommend lorenzo's 
awesome pretzel sandwiches food is fast the loaded fries are great too i highly recommend this place 
don't get me wrong on the 2 stars i loved the food the service was the problem i understand brand new getting the hang of things and plus it was lunch hour i expected you know like a 10 maybe 15 minute wait at the most took my whole lunch hour i had like 5-10 minutes left of my break to eat literally debated on leaving and just going to chipotle after i had already paid for my meal would definitely not recommend anyone to go on their lunch hour food was great though 
this place was amazing we were lucky enough to be staying nearby and the host recommended this place my family of 4 ate like kings for dinner and there were leftovers for lunch the next day too the beef tamales chile rellenos and the cheese enchiladas had a thick rich sauce on them the refried beens were so good we fought over who could finish them the flan was as good as it gets the wait wasn't long and i had a delicious margarita to make it better better yet the staff enforced mask restrictions and party size restrictions with respect 
cute place i tried the blackened chicken and it was pretty good there is no parking since it's right on bourbon street good portions and price is reasonable 
i have always loved williams-sonoma great products and good service have done several curbside pickups recently and they have been easy and convenient most recent one i was unaware they didn't open till 11 am but the employee kindly brought out my order to me i appreciated not being told to wait until they were open great customer service 
good place to get lunch has a great salad bar and a pasta bar for an additional cost 
i love cupcakes and was so thrilled to see this cute little spot in safety harbor they have a great variety of flavors and offer the most traditional flavors with a few fun flavors thrown in as well they have standard pricing for cupcakes and i like that they are the perfect size - not too big and not too small i'll be going back for a fix next time i'm in the area 
what a splended day at my local popeyes so many people were excited about the chicken sandwich i witnessed people fighting over a sandwich what nonsense when you can just order another one the food was delicious but it tore me a new one i don't think the dude did a good job cleaning up other than a few flaws i will be returning 
haha haha this place is a joke the use frozen stouffer's lasagna to pass it off as homemade 
guy outside was very friendly and talked my husband and i into going inside much to my surprise the service was awful it was 10pm and they are supposed to close at 1am the waiters were complaining about how they wanted an early night and we came in last minute i felt uncomfortable so i told my husband we should leave we didn't make it out the door before they started bad mouthing us extremely disappointed with the overall experience 
glorirod's sources beans from across the globe and then roasts them locally in tampa what a treasure only open for 4 months so far the team is genuine knowledgeable and proud of what they do- it shows today at 7am i parked right in front of the shop stopped in and ordered their current guatemalan roast in an expertly frothed and not burned or scorched large 16oz cafe con leche i also took home a bag of their colombian roast and can't wait to brew myself if you're looking for more than coffee they have everything from guava pastries to customized wellness shots to salads to freshly pressed sandwiches on your choice of bread don't pass up their award-winning cuban there is plenty of cozy space to sit and even an intimate little dining table and a reading nook with books and magazines free wifi and printing services too 
this place is great the setting and menu feels comfortable and reminiscent of a wes anderson film the attention to detail with the bar's branding shirts labels lighting and even the people is so fun to be a part of my bartender john made me a delicious bourbon cider 
i have been impressed with baja on each of my two visits thus far if you are planning to go just be prepared to wait in line the portions are huge and the ingredients all marry well together they add a tex-mex flavor to breakfast with their ingredients the menu is extensive offering many combinations of breakfast and anytime selections the bloody mary was surprisingly amazing note i am very picky about my bloodies and this was soo good just the right thickness consistency my only complaint is that the bloody mary was delivered after my meal 
i have eaten here at least 20 times and today with a band of 15 yelp uye participants the food was excellent as always and the staff was able to handle an instant doubling of clients and the food stretched like the loaves fishes as everyone shared what they ordered and kelly brought wine to complement the meal perhaps when she arrived the bottles were filled with water so pleased that a solid core of yelp faithful who are good reviewers have been able to experience this gem on armenia 
these guys are the best they are trustworthy and do solid work i went to a different shop originally to see about my leaking tire for convenience sake and was told after an hour and a half that i needed to replace the tire and that i should also replace the other one so it was going to cost just under 400 i decided to get a second opinion at fitzgerald's since i have used them before and liked my experience i waited around for 20 minutes and then was told it was fixed they took out the nail and patched it up for a total of 37 made my day i will never cheat on fitzgerald's again 
arrived around 430 pm on a sunday with 3 adults chips and salsa came promptly sever to take food order was about 20 minutes later food arrived 45 mins later nothing complicated-three tacos chicken taco salad and a quesadilla which i asked for no tomatoes and they were still on it server literally only came to take order bring food which we then had to stop him before quickly trying to walk away to refill our water and to ask if we were ready for the check after we asked for the check it still took another 11 minutes to even get that food was barely warm i could touch the back of my fingers against everything rice beans etc and barely feel any warmth and it appeared the taco salad and possibly everything had been sitting there for a long time because the entire bottom of the shell was mush manager owner middle aged non hispanic male seemed very friendly in greeting everyone seating them telling them their server would be with them shortly but never once stopped by our table to ask how everything was as did the server neither definitely not going back
i wanted to do gold but they were out of gold diamonds the lady's were super nice and work with my pickiness my nails turned out amazing and they lady even throw some glitter on my moms toes over all wonderful place 
long line two employees no urgency no customer service and over an hour from the time i got to the avis rental facility until the time i got my car terrible 
great small brewery with a great location very friendly people will definitely be back
recently left this hotel and can not say enough good things we were contacted prior to our arrival and informed that there was an issue with the room they were very apologetic and went above and beyond to make our stay a great one regardless of the issue at hand it was a small leaking roof which did not affect a thing about the room except placement of bed the hotel does not look like much from the outside but the inside of the room was tastefully decorated and updated all appliances were included as well as cookware they are beachfront and you can walk outside your door and take a short path to the beach which is beautiful as well pool was clean linen was clean and fresh would not hesitate in recommending can't wait to book another stay with them 
was not happy at all with the food we had what would normally be great foods that could be amazing if made in house and not just our ages from a purveyor and thrown in a fryer also way overpriced for the quality service was good that's about all 
this cafe is such a little gem in montecito i ordered the croque monsieur and an iced mocha with oat milk the fact that they have oat milk as a non dairy option is already a plus for me the croque was so yummy and the brioche was so fresh and fluffy i want to come back to try all of their other freshly baked goods there's some indoor seating but plenty more tables outside the weather is so perfect in montecito so even if it's brisk outside in the morning it is so pleasant to get to eat out here in this welcoming community 
we just had our floors refinished peter his crew were amazing they did a great job will definitely recommend them to my friends 
i always passed by this place when i am in new hope from the outside the patio looks amazing with the string lights i went in last week for a double date i would say the food is okay for the price especially since these are small plates service was great but i am not a fan of their reservation policy if you do not show up to the reservation you are charged 20 dollars per person what a terrible policy to implement especially 1 since it is so hard to gauge the weather with outdoor dining 2 20 dollars per person if we were to cancel is a lot to ask for especially during covid not sure if i would come back for the food but definitely a good place to go on a date 
not happy looking over the reviews here i thought i would have had a great experience not only did i not get what i asked for i thought the price was a little steep i went in for an all over color of mahogany and came out with black hair the stylist also left dye all over my forehead for 100 not including tip i should have walked out happy with my hair unfortunately i was far from satisfied the stylist was very nice and the place was very well decorated are these things enough for me to be returning probably not 
excellent customer service and stocked shelves they seem to understand that some disabled people cannot wear masks it is very easy to social distance in the store and you will not be treated poorly like at sprouts 
i've placed an order online yesterday the food was ready super fast and everything was delicious i was also surprised that the hummus portion was very big they surprised me with some free dessert baklava that was super delicious great job guys 
absolutely awful they came and started swearing at me because my boxes were full nobody told me anything about what was needed not filling up the boxes or whatever else the guys were saying we have to move all these fucking boxes i asked them what the issue was and they continued to have an awful attitude my stuff was not treated with respect and most is broken absolutely terrible company 
back at it again great service great food a wonderful spot for a graduation party had a little bit of everything and everything was good i will be back again daughters and i were looking for a new place to eat she's been going to school here for 5 years so each time i visit we try to eat somewhere new this by far is the best italian food i have had in a long time i felt like i was eating a home cooked meal in someone's home the girl that served us told us her mom decorated the place when my daughter asked for a coke and they ran out she asked one of the men that was working to grab one down the street way to go above and beyond if you find yourself on south street try this place it's wonderful i am hungry now 
incredible coffee we just stopped for coffee to go and did not sample the pastries including a delicious looking selection of savory croissants but i have no doubt they are fabulous and next time we are in the area we will be sure to come by again 
my word whenever i come into philadelphia a stop at the reading terminal is a must for me stopping in at beiler's is unavoidable the smell from the bakery beckons to come over and start buying and buying a lot once the store opens at 8 the game is on the line starts to form of salivating customers and it grows longer and longer as the day progresses that does not change the rosy attitude of the staff they are genuinely happy people and love to tell you about their amazing baked goods it makes standing in that long line seem less time consuming and more of a way for you to believe in the old saying good things come to those who wait one of my favorite things other than the donuts to get there is the apple dumpling similar to a pie and the consistency of a turnover it is absolutely delicious and a proud hallmark of their bakery a good donut and muffin can be found anywhere with some good research but an apple dumpling can never be replicated and these folks do it right do yourself right and buy some baked goods from these awesome people but do it before sunday because they are not open on sunday 
we drove down to the shrimp docks to get some shrimp and while there asked if they knew of anywhere we could buy crab and fish they recommended the crab hut we've driven by here a few times and was never tempted to go in it's not a pretty place but we love places like this and finally went in people were coming in and out it's obviously a popular place old run down dark dilapidated just our kind of place but it looked clean and didn't smell horrible for a fish market the mother daughter working here were very nice offered lots of advise on how to cook the blue crabs we bought 1 2 a dozen of the large ones for dinner we also bought a red snapper which they fileted for us the fish alone was 16 not cheap at all but we got 2 good filets which were plenty for dinner i like that they had a good variety of fish to choose from snapper mullet grouper tilapia and i forgot the rest so much better than publix where it's salmon or tilapia we won't buy the crabs again though just not enough meat on blue crabs and too much work to get the little you do get they were good so if you like this kind of crab this is the place to get them we'll be back to try some other kind of fish for sure 
i like panera better so this place is average they serve the same kind of food- fast food sandwiches salads soup etc healthier option compared to chick fil la in the mall but it was hard coming here vs going to get those waffle fries this place is located by the riverfront so closer to downtown wilmo vs christina mall but if got time and a car i recommend going to the christina mall compared to the rest of the lunch food prices in wilmo this is a better option only issue is that parking is kind of hard to find and it is located beneath an office building i probably wouldn't come back but it is due to location and time don't have that much time for lunch 
yo dude as leo would say i simply love this studio its a bit of a commute for me and totally worth it the lay out is great everything is new clean and fresh i can always find free parking within a block actually usually right out front which is a treat in the city if you are local there is even a bike rack the showers the instructors the owners the decor the eucalyptus scented towels and of course the yoga all great they even bring in fresh pressed juice i first took leo's class many years ago and i have been a fan of bikram and his class ever since he has been doing this a long time and it shows 
domino's owes me money for food not received it's been 5 weeks and still nothing i spoke with several people who said they'd handle and still nothing they are thieving liars imo what's the problem 
update review i've just clocked 500 adjustments with dr boles and i feel good i came with a background of neck shoulder arm pain sometimes so bad it was immobilizing i've been helpless in tears in significant pain until i found this type of therapy almost 5 years ago if you haven't dealt with chronic pain be very grateful i don't think there's anything worse my neck pain shoulder peck arm pain and numbness is basically non-existent now i have found that as parts of your body heals other pains pop up as your body begins to heal the next thing that experienced trauma in your lifetime now we're working on hips and tailbone as a 7th grader i remember falling directly on my tailbone on the hard gym floor we've already worked through the trauma from the car accidents i have been in as a teen driver i cannot recommend this therapy enough if you are struggling it's worth your quality of life to find a way to fix it i'm talking long term relief before i found exodus i was doing all the things in order to keep the pain at bay chiropractic neck traction massage therapy not the relaxing kind acupuncture physical therapy i tried it all and each thing would provide enough relief to get me to the next thing very short-lived relief unfortunately quality of life is everything i am and have been committed to my health in this arena and i've been reaping the benefits i love the staff here i love dr boles i love that they can pray for you when you're feeling hopeless and i'm so grateful to be living a normal pain-free mostly life there is -nothing- like it i've also seen my x-rays that prove that my previous curvature the opposite of what it should be to current is unbelievable it's finally curving a ton more towards the way it was meant to praise be my x-rays have also shown the areas where we need to work and focus on for my adjustments like a recent tailbone pain i'm just so incredibly thankful i would highly recommend exodus chiropractic in franklin tn your health and quality of life is invaluable and worth every penny also thank you dr boles and doris sydney and hanna - and all the others that were here before this lovely group i'm forever indebted to you all and thank you for the 500 milestone card flowers and gift you all are like family and exodus is like home 
so many silly mistakes by management for our one night stay we had paid for club level but when we arrived they had discontinued the evening portion of club level but they didn't tell us that at check in the lines for check in were very long so when i went to complain i stood there forever overhearing really a lot of complaints from other guests - apparently one guest overheard someone say the city water would be turned off from midnight to 7 am yet no one had informed her as i tired of waiting in line i asked a guy standing at the concierge station about the evening club level and he said the hotel had discontinued evening hours but he would go get me some vouchers for the bar he came back and said he was wrong the club level should be open and his manager would come out shortly and open it up we had to leave for a dinner reservation so we don't know if he ever did open it up but when we checked after dinner it was closed i was able to procure vouchers for beverages at the desk which was great however not being informed of the closure and having to stand in line for a long time to resolve the issue while the manager sat in the back without jumping in to help was super irritating they also said the breakfast would be open until 10 when it was actually meant to close at 9 30 they let us in anyway at 9 35 the breakfast was fine but every table was dirty and the silverware was sticky despite the manager standing right there in the room but a room with a breakfast and no evening offerings isn't really what i'd consider club level it's just bed and breakfast the room was nice if small i don't think we'll be returning - there are so many hotels that communicate better keep their promise to folks who have paid extra for club level offer clean eating conditions update the management waived our tab at the art cafe which was very nice adding a star for that 
best greek food i have had in a while i had the gyros platter and the lamb was absolutely amazing service was fantastic very clean and welcoming atmosphere definitely recommend it
such a great place for amazing mexican food after seeing over 3000 reviews for this place we decided to try it for dinner it was amazing with some really great options when you enter the place you place the order first and then go look for a table there was a pretty long queue to order but they were pretty quick in taking orders we got ourselves a garden burrito poblano tacos and nachos the guy who took our order suggested the vegetarian taco and it was amazing the food was delish especially the tacos for vegetarians they were well made and came with a bowl of super awesome black beans the garden burrito was great too but the nachos was not as good as the other two i would skip the nachos next time around they serve chips with the order and have a bar of salsas and add-ins like cilantro lime pico and jalape os the avocado sauce and medium salsa were our favorites from the bar next time that we are in santa barbara definitely going back to this place 
the conference arranged lunch for us at this restaurant it was closed for general business to accommodate us we started with a cup of gumbo perfect roux and spices the field green salad with a ball of fried goat cheese was pretty much the best salad i've had in a long time the fried goat cheese was divine we all got the smothered chicken with mashed potatoes for an entree i usually do not like smothered chicken but this was delicious the deep fried chicken breasts were tender and covered with the right amount of gravy for dessert we were served pecan pie with rum in it it was pretty much the best pecan pie i've ever had the restaurant is located inside the wyndham riverfront hotel and you can enter from either the hotel lobby on convention center blvd or fulton street a great place for business lunch 
it's 100 authentic food the staff is very friendly i highly recommend this place for a quick grab and go 
most of those stars came from the entertainment the music was great the food wasn't gumbo came out cold actually below room temp nacho fries were ehhh po boy was ok 
what can i say just great 1 impression from outside says it all clean nice looking 2 check in very fast and friendly 3 inside looks great and very clean 4 service is outstanding 5 buffet is wow so many different stuff cuban sandwich pulled pork sliders mac and cheese liver fish all kinds of chicken soups huge salad buffet big assortment on desserts including soft serve and and and trust me you can't go wrong here you will love it we will be back soon 
holy mother of delicious mediterranean food adam our server was amazing the food from the appetizer to the entree was amazing decor - yep amazing just everything easy parking great energy i can't wait to tell my friends about this place and to go back again those flavor profiles mama mia so good 
this place was great when it was new and renaud was doing all the work but recently i ordered an almond croissant and they put it in a bag for take out i then drove downtown to meet a friend at a park and when i pulled the croissant out of the bag i discovered it was badly burnt it literally looked like it was thrown on a bbq grill and seared on high until it was black hard crusty on the way home i returned the item and the lady at the register was very snooty first she had to inspect it to see if i was being fussy but fortunately she gave me the green light to replace it with a new one i told her no i would like a refund and she went into the rolling the eyes mode and i'm pretty sure this lady was the owners wife - in any case she had a french accent i was trying to be cool at no point did i mention that i drove it to a park and ended up starving because i couldn't eat it they have been expanding and you know what always comes with that reduction of quality service bummer here's a suggestion for renaud next time in this situation immediately apologize and replace the item no questions asked in addition throw in a free item and thank us for our business 
this has become my favorite place to eat breakfast place in new orleans awesome atmosphere with amazing food just all around an awesome place to have breakfast away from all the tourist and the quarter id give this place 10 stars if i could
i've been to this location a few times and it's always good i drove by today only to see it was closed for business which is odd considering this is a new location and it just opened a few months ago 
food is always good and yummy they are fast and always helpful but it definitely needs some good cleaning so many flies and a dead mouse on the floor lost our appetite needs some tlc
stopped in for a drink on a thursday live bands on every floor was cool went on the roof top to have a beer 2 bud lights 13 00 don't know if that's the going rate service was excellent food looked real good and seemed reasonably price nashville police officers present in bar is a good site good job bob 
i stopped in to grab a few things for the ride to jfk i rarely shop at the chain unless i'm traveling and then i appreciate being able to get healthier items and care less about the cost the best thing is when i got back to the car i saw a couple more of isaiah zagar tile murals i missed and we got to see another alley full of art before we left town 
great place for a family this zoo is beautiful and just small enough for a quick family visit compared to the phila zoo which is also great but lots of walking i love the zip-lines as well as the bar where they often play live music very affordable as well we bought a season pass and go there at least every other weekend go feed a giraffe 
started off on a bad foot with the hostess staff there is a stupid revolving door that lets into a rather small waiting area on a monday night it was standing room only at the front door so had to make two revolutions in the revolving door before there was room to step inside waited in a line 4-deep to check in asked for a table for 2 but she did not ask for our name just said ok we'll seat you in a few minutes another hostess who takes you to your seats only announces table for 2 or table for 4 etc it's left up to your fellow patrons to determine who was there first we waited to the side of the hostess stand for 5 minutes or so while we're waiting another party of 2 walks in the door checks in at the hostess stand and she said right this way to them at that point we had to throw a small tantrum that we were obviously there before they were and were still waiting to be seated the hostess looked at us perplexed and asked what our name was we told her we were never asked for our name still looking perplexed she told another hostess to seat us but never did apologize for the screw-up they really need to improve on their process at the front door while we were waiting we noticed another party of 3 that had to question the hostess why they hadn't been seated yet no one wants to start their dinner pissed off the food is good the service is hit or miss thankfully when other waiters notice your drinks are empty they'll get you another just in case your waiter is a dud a plus is free refills on their in-house root beer cream sodas which are delicious i felt rushed by our waiter - he brought the check before we finished eating and he took the signed receipt w tip from me before we left reluctantly i signed up for their rewards program only because i now know you can get 20 off with mobile pay and preferred seating but because i only like them for their food and nothing else i'll probably do carry-out from now on update been here a few more times since original post and all is good now i still love the food and wait staff have been great they offer some good discounts through their rewards program 
i went to cracker barrel for the first time a week ago for a breakfast get together with family i'd heard good things about cracker barrel but there are other restaurants serving breakfast closer to me i had the old timer's breakfast which was good but the bacon was a bit overcooked and crunchy the portions are huge and other than the bacon issue was very good waitress was attentive despite being a very busy day and prices were reasonable i love the little store area at cracker barrel great idea for people waiting for a table to kill time and cracker barrel makes money cute items in the shop 
despite the reasonable prices the food is mediocre and the service is downright horrible not worth the trip 
decor-wise this place is a beauty i definitely would recommend coming here for get-togethers but with that being said be prepared for an above average noise level the reason why i give buddakan three stars is because the quality of its food really did not blow me away many items on the menu are on the spicy side and while they are good the speed at which food was served was a little on the slow side also a lot of the dishes i tried came out much saltier than expected sitting in a corner i felt like waiters often forgot about us in terms of refilling our waters and whatnot definitely give buddakan a try if you enjoy high-end asian food but i think it really is only rated so highly because it's the only high-end asian restaurant in philadelphia 
this review is for cupcakes and cake only i have not tried their food although i want to soon first off their cupcakes are way cheaper than other cupcake places in town and by that i mean they're actually affordable and to top it they're yummy for my little sisters bday i ordered 12 vanilla cupcakes with vanilla buttercream frosting they were ready for pickup on time and he even asked if i wanted some toppings for free i took him up on the offer and got silver pearly balls the girls thought they were so pretty to top it off they were very yummy for my moms wedding in july we ordered a lemon cake with vanilla frosting and a design off of a pattern on her invite they replicated it very well we also had three kinds of cupcakes chocolate vanilla coconut and strawberry lemonade the strawberry were sooooo good the price was insanely affordable overall good for baked goods will order more cupcakes here 
the new jalapeno burger is really good doesnt look like the picture on the commercial size of a regular burger with white cheese and jalapeno nit too spicy not burny great flavor
the worst service anywhere we've been the tables were left unbussed dirty we were seated by a middle-aged woman that didnt smile once 4 of us and 3 place settings waitress looked unkept and was not happy all around us we heard people asking where their food was after 20min i went and got a place setting for my father-in-law at that time i heard more tables complain and heard the mgr say drive thru orders go first so you will have to wait really we dine inside and tip-why do we get ignored after 40 min and no food i went to ask thw young kid said i dont know why foods taking so long maybe since its sat i asked to talk to his mgr the mgr never came out went back to our table and there were 6 tables complaining the mgr came out to one table and said he would rush their meal he didnt address anyone else finally 45 min later our food arrived food was fine-but fries were cold none of us ate the fries the restaurant didnt comp anything and didn't address the almost hour to get food terrible staff yest terrible mgment dirty dining room and will never go back to this steak n shake 
delicious pralines and great service i needed about 40 bite sized pralines individually wrapped i called up ms k's and she had them ready by that evening and for a very good price she was friendly and accommodating and did i mention how delicious the pralines were i highly recommend ms k's 
every time i've had to go to a branch i have always been treated kindly and with respect i've dealt with numerous employees and have never had any issues and in fact it's been excellent service if you have to sit down with a representative they explain everything so you can understand it the tellers are always smiling when you go in and greet you kindly i highly recommend pffcu to anyone 
rhoda and her team rock my precious angel is now resting in peace as he died of cancer on easter monday 2020 rhoda and her team are awesome he was a bichon and this is the only place i would recommend for grooming i explored a few other avenues prior and each time he looked like another dog once i took him to rhoda he actually looked like rex the bichon we loved dearly thank you for all of your kindness to my sweet boy 
i want to start by saying that the service was beyond terrible the waitress who greeted us smelled weird luckily she wasn't our waitress but it didn't get any better a couple came in 10 minutes after us and their order came in 5-7 minutes we we waited for about 40 mins then the waitress we had forgot multiple things that were part of our order we had to keep telling her what was missing on top of that the food wasn't great i've been to other denny's and the food was always great my daughter's mozzarella sticks tasted like they were microwaved and old the cheese wasn't even melted the breading was stale it was horrible my daughter didn't even finish her meal bc it was so bad another couple came in and waited at their table for 20 mins before someone went to ask them if they wanted water the couple got up and left and the wife yelled that the service sucks in which the caucasian waitress mumbled she's right our service does suck and proceeded to blame the african american waitress and said it was her fault which even if it was you shouldn't say that loud enough for customers to hear now the woman who seems to be the manager started talking to the table behind ours and proceeded to talk about someone's relationship and how someone's husband was in jail loud enough that we heard the whole conversation which seemed inappropriate maybe if they stopped gossiping they can get orders right and give better service lastly there was 1 cook poor guy was taking like 20 orders which seems unfair i guess he tried as much as he could to keep up but at one point he said something like hes trying to go as fast as he can and the caucasian waitress said take your time there's no rush granted we wanted our food in a timely fashion but telling the cook there's no rush is ridiculous i wish we would have walked out of there but we tried to tough it out the service and food there was such a disappointment and the place isn't very clean as we were paying the caucasian waitress apologized for the customers out burst and again blamed the african american waitress which again is inappropriate please do better thank you 
love this place usually have the reuben or the pastrami sandwich both solid their brownies are also very good honestly would've been 5 star but for two issues 1 the ordering can be tedious there's usually a long line at lunch hour the credit card machine has failed a number of times making the line worse and then you have fight past the people at the register to pick up your food when it's ready and 2 the price is a bit high considering the pricing of nearby competitors 
you can bring your kids dogs your dog kids and more there are enough bathrooms for twice the capacity of the place games couches giant connect four games great and i mean great cider i'm not even a cider person after a bad bout of 2002 cider left me sick but man it's good only complaints here even though i'm not star removing are they just kept pumping the music louder recently with nobody other than the person with the knob wanting the music louder conversations all around were can't hear you this music is loud did you want it louder did anyone also they seriously need food or a broken down food truck outside 
maybe if the people who answered the phones weren't so rude and sound so inconvenienced you'd have better reviews 
7th person to review this mcdonalds located on eagle and magic view dr and inside a jackson chevron convenient store this is my 422nd review on yelp i've visited this location several times and each time i have the service has been meh-to-okay and on the slow side it is clean though and the service is average to good be sure to allow yourself some time-- don't stop here if you are short on time 
i had these guys come out for service and a small repair on my a c units at my home to make a very long story as short as possible i paid 590 00 for a service agreement and a repair that wasn't done properly when i called to the office to speak to the owner a young lady took a message he didn't call me back and after a few days i called the office again again he didn't call me back and after a few days i called the office again after still not receiving a call i called the office again demanded a refund and threatened to file a complaint with the bbb and contest the charge with my credit card company guess what he finally called back and after a long discussion argument he agreed to refund me half of the original charge the check came a few days later and it was 33 00 short of half of what i paid don't use this company they'll rob you blind if you let them 
there is no fast in the food here the servers are incredibly incompetent only go here if absolutely necessary you'd need to be starving to death 
love this place def stop by for their fri night dinner pizzas and get all of their bread i came here after my foodie buddy could not stop raving about alex bois and his baking genius i will say that while walking around this neighborhood may be a tiny bit dicey if you're by yourself it is much safer if you're walking from fishtown while i wish they offered half loaves i can't complain about the three types of bread including the beet rye the japanese white bread and the multigrain nuts bread the pizza was actually quite delicious and unique although by the time of this delayed review i've forgotten what was on it and served over a fresh bed a salad long story short if you love bread stop by this place 
similar experience to others i scheduled an appointment between 8am and noon took the day off of work and sat on the couch waiting for a knock at the door at 12 45 no one had shown up and no one had called me saying no one was showing up when i called sears home service i was told the repairman had called out sick that morning i expressed that i was not very happy at all and requested that someone else be sent out i was told another repairman would show up that afternoon with an eta of 4pm at nearly 5 o'clock no one had shown up and no one had called me to tell me they weren't showing up i once again called sears home service was not given an explanation as to why no one showed up or called me and was simply told that all repairmen were done working for the day i was offered a new appointment in two weeks which i declined 
i don't know why this place has bad reviews maybe they're going there for different reasons that me i go here every year for a annual skin check with karen myers and i like seeing her she's nice personable seems to know her stuff and is attentive to what i want i've experienced so many doctors in the past that are rude to me and don't listen to my concerns so it's nice having one who actually listens i've also had surgery with dr hu and have no complaints 
so this would be a better review except they have a very strange and difficult coupon policy we were there with another couple and with 5 other strangers if you have ever been to a hibatchi type place you know you are seated around a large cook top and typically share this with others after the meal we presented a small coupon and were told it is only one per table because one of the other people not in our group used a coupon we couldn't use ours one per table our waitress said we tried to explain that they weren't apart of our party but it didn't matter probably a big enough issue to not return beware 
we've had to call davis a couple of times the first was what we perceived an emergency they came out right away showed us the issue and explained it wasn't as bad as we thought they arrived when they said they would after normal business hours and repaired the problem promptly most recently we called davis as we were having issues with the workings of our toilets again they came out promptly as scheduled and repaired the problem quickly the technician on both occasions was tommy he was polite respectful and did his work quickly you can't ask for more than quick courteous service i highly recommend this company 
good food at this restaurant i had the 1000 spruce burger which actually is huge and you need to cut in half or quarters having lunch with my oldest daughter her boyfriend and his mother been here before and the service is fast and the waitress periodically checked on us to be sure everyone is fine we all had the pretzel bread with jalapeno cheese dip which is very good food was good and the rest of the party had cobb salad which was huge and they couldn't finish eating it 
these folks are as great as the others reviews said they were punctual responsive respectful knowledgeable effective affordable the carpets were dirty and spotted before and afterwards they are beautiful real green even removed spots left by previous cleaners all that and environmentally friendly i couldn't have had a better result 
wow just found this joint due to a major traffic backup on the highway my wife and i absolutely loved the food and you couldn't beat the service if you tried amazing we live an hour away and will make the trip because it is worth it 
my opinion on maryannes has really come to change over the last couple of years this place was a miss for me when it first opened but now i love it the breakfast selection goes above and beyond typical diner fare and is modestly priced wait staff are attentive and this place is always clean 
without slamming ruby river too hard i will keep it short and simple came here for a date night with the hopes of a good steak and left with a feeling of waisted time and money service was good the staff is very friendly and attentive drinks strong but with flat soda food peanuts 7 out of 10 are rotten yuk - my date got filet mignon one bite and immediately we knew that meat shouldn't have that flavor it tasted un-natural and definitely not worth the he was hungry and never a picky eater and he chose not to eat another bite - i got the halibut with a baked potato and asparagus the fish was over cooked but edible so we nibbled on it the potato was good hard to mess that up the asparagus was raw so i did not eat those and we left half of the fish untouched the manager and waiter both came by right after the food was delivered and the reality of having to send our food back hadn't yet set in so when asked if the food was ok we said yes after a few minutes we let the waiter know that the steak was unacceptable our waiter took that dinner off the bill and simply apologized for my asparagus being undercooked as they all sat there untouched i didn't want to ask for anything else but when a waiter clears the table of food where both plates are mostly untouched that should be a red flag to perhaps offer additional discount or coupon something cost 1 beer 1 cocktail and 1 dinner still cost 60 sorry folks but i would consider other steakhouse next time 
i've been through several escape rooms in different cities and this one is by far the best our guide was antoinette and she was awesome she made the experience really special and entertaining while also being an excellent host to our group the room we did was the jazz parlor and the puzzles in this room are very well thought out and inventive we were amazed more and more as we progressed through the room we will definitely return to do more rooms here and will request antoinette we are locals but highly recommend this place for tourists as well 
absolutely amazing customer service staff is very genuine merchandise is definitely the best i saw in downtown with the selection and prices so many t-shirt design and color choices it was so hard to pick just one if you want a momentum from your nashville trip definitely make this a stop on your list guaranteed you'll find at least one thing probably more that's worthy of your money 
excellent service all around valet was effortless and left cookies for us upon leaving food was incredible we ordered the breakfast hand pies and the three meal certainly want to come back to try more service in house was very accommodating manager owner and chef stopped by asking how everything was which was nice only slight issue put a specialty bloody marry and or mimosa on the main cocktail menu most guests had either or vs the specialty cocktails and add a piece of bacon to the bloody extras
i follow belladonna on instagram and have always wanted to go into the shop as i think they have such adorable things i was treating my 14 year old sister and her friend to a girls day as they had a rough day at school the day before when we found ourselves doing some shopping on magazine excited to see the store we went on in my sister and her friend both have vivid hair colors immediately we watched the entire time as if we were going to steal or break something i could tell the girls were feeling uncomfortable but they wanted to look and were having a good time i tried my best to not be bothered by it and to make them enjoy themselves they were simply looking around when we found ourselves at the makeup we once again immediately had two associates next to us the taller woman with short wavy brown hair quite loudly shouts there are applicators use them if you insist on trying on i was shocked and said oh i'm so sorry as my sister had simply swiped on small swipe of eyeshadow with her finger i'm shocked by the rude customer service here it's not so much what she said but the tone just because a customer my not look the way you like does not mean we are to be treated less what a disappointment it really embarrassed my little sister and her friend who were trying to have a fun day out 
this is by far my favorite italian restaurant in the broad ripple area every dish is amazing 
great food and the wait staff are very pleasant i e eaten there many times for lunch and looking forward to trying it for dinner 
the staff here is very friendly and professional and the massages are okay it's been a real hit-or-miss experience with some of the therapists seeming quite inexperienced though and i do wish i had paid more attention to the fact that their non-member prices are twice as expensive as any place around before i committed to 6 months of services which renews automatically unless you remember to cancel so it's really not a great deal also there is only one esthetician between the two locations so the availability for facials is scant i would say i was disappointed but that it's my own fault for making an impulsive decision to sign up for membership without doing my research i appreciate what they do but there is a local massage company that does a much better job for a lot less money no commitment required 
my husband and i just discovered this restaurant and are amazed at how wonderful the food is the price is a bit high but worth it considering that they are absolutely catering to your desires and will improvise a soup instead of a salad my husband tried a variety of items on the menu and enjoyed every one i always stick to my greek burger done with a veggie patty which is the best i have ever had and we are world travelers the miso soup which i had was divine and my husband had a broccoli cheese or cream of potato soup which was filling and tasty they are extremely accommodating and the atmosphere is great excellent menu selection once we discovered this restaurant we went there 3 times in one week then the next week we went back twice in the week the service it could speed up a bit but usually a salad or soup comes with the lunch or dinner entree so the timing isn't too bad an improvement would be speedier service which is no problem to fix since the food is great and the staff is welcoming we are extremely happy that we discovered windingcreek grill and will be frequenters once we settle in our new home in eagle captain and mrs thornburg
failed to locate and remove rodent i paid 379 for a 2 week guaranteed service after 2 weeks the tech called me and told me that he knew the rodent was there but could not get him the tech packed up his traps left the property without consulting with me first what about the guarantee after 2 days service returned my calls and offered to have a tech meet me at the building so i could pay more for additional pest entryways closure i had already paid for an allstar tech to go around the building and close off any pest entryways 
service king on reservoir road in west chester did an excellent repair of my damaged mazda cx-5 for the 2nd time in 2 or 3 years both times the staff was courteous and professional and did beautiful repairs on my mazda i cannot even tell where the damage was the work was completed in a timely manner and i was amazed it only took about a week good going guys and kristen at the front desk for a job well done i highly recommend this service king if you need help with collision service dr ron briglia
this place is absolutely horrible they serve you food on dirty plates then their food has a weird fishy taste and you didn't even order fish the new bring it to the managers attention and all you got was a salad that came with the meal that you sent back but they force you to pay for the salad this place sucks
this place was a let down the food was ok and maybe even 3-stars worthy however portions sizes were small for the price price also didn't match the deli-style atmosphere and service was slow also they use a lot of oil - so be prepared for that i got the vegetarian platter for 13 it was small and i ended up ordering a second entree - the fried eggplant this was delicious - but for another 13 it definitely wouldn't have filled me up as a single entree baba and hummus were good i've had better falafel - their's was a bit greasy the tabbouleh was also not my favorite a lot of parsley i did like that i could pick my own drink my partner got the shrimp platter his comment was it was good but it was greasy 
if you're in nashville the listening room should be at the top of your list of things to do it's a cafe by day venue by night with 2 showings 6pm and 8 30pm even if you're not a country fan i'm not really the performers play a wide variety of songs and most of them are acoustic the host of the place i stayed at recommended checking out the listening room during my stay she told me about how songwriters came to the stage and played their original songs before being bought and played by singers it was an interesting premise so decided to check it out i tried buying tickets on the day of for the 8 30pm show and they were sold out so let that be a lesson to you guys buy your tix early i showed up and they told me that they create a waitlist and after 8 45pm they'll check the no-show lists and begin seating i was able to snag a bar seat for 14 i had the pleasure of seeing kelly archer darby justin ebach jordan minton who all played and sang lovely acoustic versions of their songs there is is 15 minimum to spend per person i got the sangria while i was there because i was warned about their food by my host sangria was okay nothing to write home about overall a wonderful experience 
love this place we've lived in the area for two years and finally made it out to parksdale it's much more than a produce market if produce is your goal you're set here they've got nearly everything and plenty of it good thing too because they get busy you can try loads of samples as well so if you're indecisive about which florida orange you might like best take a sample and try before you buy beyond the produce there are tchotchkes of all kinds to buy florida themed garden themed all kinds of goodies you'll also find a variety of parksdale jams and jelly sauces and other crafted tasties but while you're there you must try the strawberry shortcake that thing is massive and delightful it's 5 and worth it plant city is known for their strawberries and the reason is evident with this dessert amazing they have other goodies too if strawberry shortcake isn't your thing there are plenty of spaces to sit and enjoy your treats in a cute covered garden area this area is on the opposite side of the building from where you actually order so you'll need to walk through the shop first we love this place and can not wait to go back 
a must if you're in santa barbara and looking for good mexican food the agaves burrito is the best huge shrimp fish guacamole rice bathed in the los agaves special sauce the mango dressing on the salad that's included is one of the best dressings i've had smooth sweet but not too sweet 
we are in love with caleb's wow wow and wow the food is always amazing and the staff are lovely as is the atmosphere it is also a lovely touch that caleb comes out and checks in and says hello to all making you feel like a part of the family it is our go-to place and we send all of our friends too 
this place should be ashamed of itself i feel like it's complete horse manure that they give you the option to sandwich your burger in lettuce instead of a bread bun but then charge you a full 0 50 for the privilege some people can't eat bread and i appreciate when a restaurant has the market sense to provide options for those people but to charge them extra for lettuce which undoubtedly costs less than the bread that's not being eaten is taking advantage -- and a slap in the face 
great location near bourbon street friendly helpful staff reasonable price at 85 a night for sunday 
this park is a great place to enjoy the river the grass is always nice to sit in the river is a few feet away there is a path you can bike or walk on too i'm not sure how long the path is but it follows the river which is nice they have picnic tables shade under the trees as well i love this park 
i love this place - it has just the right mix of awesome foods from appetizers to inventive burgers and sandwiches also the drink selection and cold bar foods are fantastic come here at least once a week
friendly clean healthy and delicious just about sums up my experience the kids wanted subway and i couldn't eat there so i yelped for a fast food place and was absolutely lucky to have picked this place the food took less than 8 minutes was prepared well and packaged with nachos salsa napkins and the works kids abandoned their subway sandwiches and ate it up nice work staff management and owners 
this place is amazing everything there is so good all of it is gluten free too the staff are super friendly and helpful 
great place for vegetarians we got the chili tater tots and a tofu sandwich the portion sizes are relatively large and the food was a bit on the spicy side a little bit crowded when we were there at around 10 pm 
we live close and we were exited to try it out first let me tell you how nice the owners and servers are second complimentary fried bananas for all at the end of the meal yay and yum they came with a side of honey to drizzle over them we started the meal with fresh spring rolls and pot stickers love thai pot stickers that come with a side of panang sauce they were excellent the fresh spring rolls were good but i think i prefer vietnamese spring rolls textures a bit more my friend ordered the tom yum noodle soup she's adventurous it had shrimp squid and fish balls in it she liked it and there was plenty for leftovers i had the chicken panang curry spice level 2 their panang sauce was wonderful the green beans and carrots were cooked yet still crisp i also had enough for leftovers we were talking with some other folks in the restaurant and they had just ordered the mango with sticky rice and he let us each have a bite that's a must for the next visit the location is in a strip mall so its nothing fancy the prices are reasonable as well we will be visiting again for either dine in or take out 
i went to sonic twice in one night we went around 9 30pm and tried to order some limeade and tater tots and they were out of limes i ended up with one of the cream slushes and my friend tried the mango breeze beverage without the lime bc we're out of limes which turned out to be a fruity soda the cream slush was basically milkshake thickness with the addition of granita like ice crystals from the slush the tots were under fried and not the crispy golden brown you can achieve with like frozen tots and your own oven a few hours later 1am we returned post dancing drove up to one of the parking slots put in our order for a large strawberry limeade and a large lime slush more tots my friend just wanted more tots despite their crappiness and french fries we waited to be told that they were out of limes but instead they took the order we paid using the little credit card slot and then we waited and waited and waited one of the sonic employees walks over and says you guys have to go through the drive through they're not letting anyone out with food and the speakers at the drive in slots were turned off and then everyone sitting in the drive in parking slots starts honking bc they the drivers are morons one of the staff says we should have gone to mcdonald's and we say- we already paid he talks to us way too much eventually the manager started walking out orders including for us a medium sprite 7-up large slush fries and the tots and we had to get the soda switched for the limeade the fries were also underdone and limp i don't get how they can mess up with deep fried food- stop frying when it's crispy brown but not black strawberry limeade-- great stuff refreshing not overly sweet with slices of strawberries hanging out at the bottom occasionally getting stuck in your straw and this is why i would totally go back to sonic despite the uneven staff and mediocre food 
familiar and affordable italian food my husband said his lasagna was the best he has ever had and i was impressed at the amount of crabmeat in my salad we will be back 
well this review is a little delayed i completed my challenge for anyone following of hitting all the top 50 bars of 2012 in 2013 hence why its delayed i am writing this in 2014 but i was here in december after reading the reviews i knew ahead of time to always order another drink before i was done with my current due to the slow service if you do that by the time your done the next one is out and your never without a drink but the service was a little slow but our waitress was helpful and friendly the far east very spicy thai chilies ginger scallion white wine mussel were delicious i don't recall them being very spicy but there was a kick the beer selections was solid over all i like the place wasn't wowed but wasn't too disappointed either 
we had an early dinner here and though we really enjoyed the flavors of the food the portions are small i got the beef tacos 3 very small soft shell tacos super delicious but definitely more of a side or appetizer size that's no problem usually but the pricing made me think it was a much larger portion 
my wife and i enjoyed her birthday weekend in nashville this past weekend after all of our celebrating on our way home i scheduled an 80 minute couples massage we arrived at the woodhouse on time and it was easy to find checked in and they toured us around the facility gave us some paper work to fill out in the relaxing room and we were on our way we hydrated for about 15 minutes in our robes with a heated neck pad that was very soothing our masseuse took a few moments to find out what we liked in a massage and they were very accommodating i am more deep tissue and my wife likes a swedish type massage i would mention their names but didn't get authorization to do so our experience was great and the price was within normal spa pricing for a couples massage i highly suggest you try this spa the facility is modern clean and a very relaxing space 
i had a gift card and almost didn't come here because of the overall negative reviews so glad i did waiter was very attentive filled our drinks regularly the food was way better than i expected i would have been very happy to pay without the gift card will come here again 
the food was good but you must pick up from a house and the gps couldn't locate the address luckily i was able to call and the young lady was very patient and gave me the correct directions 
the food and drinks are amazing here josh the bartender there makes some of the best drinks you will ever have 
my favorite ice cream shop in tampa i love that they have new and interesting flavors all the time 
this hotel is fantastic i stayed for a week for work training and thoroughly enjoyed my stay everyone was so nice and friendly even the maid service the cleanliness was top notch the rooms are specious the beds are comfy and the bathrooms are super modern and nice breakfast was plentiful and delicious lots of options great stay and would definitely stay again right across the street from airport and right down the street from the mall and tampa bay stadium 
setting things up was super easy but rain postponed our event so i can't speak to cara's skill 150 deposit lost but no one's fault 
omg delicious we love coming here the food is fresh and the service is great the atmosphere is classic rock music with picnic tables and very casual 
i bought a car from burns in september in february i brought my car in for a recall and oil change when i brought it the burns employee logged it in with the correct mileage but when i picked it up my paperwork reflected approximately 70 miles more with my gas bdepleted too when i complained the technician told us no one drove it this is the same technician that told us 4 hours and never updated me that it would take 2 and a half more hours i had to keep calling to get an update mind you i had to be some where and ended up canceling my plans because they took so long then they sent the van to bring me back and he never spoke a word until i got out of the car he also played his very young music very loud be careful something shrewd is going on 
glad to have a poke restaurant in town it's decent but could be better in some regards cons -the rice was hard and crunchy in spots i ordered the half white rice half salad as there's rice in every bite it was disappointing that the right consistency was not there we came right at noon so the rice should have been fresher -noisy very hard to have a conversation despite only 3 tables with diners at the time -lack of flavor you can select your sauce for the fish then pick additional sauce to top it off despite this the bowl still needed a large drench of sauce from the self serve condiment station -parking hit or miss finding a spot close by pros -large portions i got a scoop of tuna and salmon and while the amount of fish was on the small side the bowl was huge once you factor in the toppings -the sauces are tasty the eel sauce wasn't too sweet and the ginger soy was very good -friendly service and vibe -decent price for fish 2 small bowls 2 scoops fish each and 2 fountain drinks came out to 25 40 before tip overall not bad but some room for improvement with better rice this would easily be 4 stars 
unless you're just drinking don't bother with this place the food is absolutely disgusting my tator tots were incredibly salty and inedible my friend ordered a margarita flatbread that was still frozen really regret spending my hard earned money here i won't be back such an awful experience 
yup my new favorite breakfast place clean comfortable and quaint environment staff was super attentive and the food was delicious already told 5 people about it i'll be back 
i was hesitant at first buying a car is stressful but these guys made me feel like home i will be returning here to buy my wife's car this year they were helpful clear about what to expect gave us time to talk and think without being pressured i'm not sure what the deal with some of these bad reviews are but wasn't my experience at all thanks guys for getting me an awesome car i'd give 10 stars if i could 
two words - so delicious we were seated right away got attended right away and the food was definitely not behind and was super shocked how quick we got are food which by the way was amazing the eggs to the waffle french toast you name it it was all delicious we are from out of town and found good reviews on yelp definitely did not disappoint up might be going back tomorrow before we leave 
worst experience i've ever had this company is a total scam do not buy their warranty beware i read the contract word for word this warranty does not cover most of the parts that will fail in a normal car and they will not pay for the service after making over 50 phone calls in the last 3 months i still have not received my money back with their money back guarantee all the positive reviews are fake please beware i have to hide my real name because they made me sign a document stating that i must remove all negative reviews or they will not refund money along with other ridiculous terms that is how crooked they are
i'm surprised at how many bad reviews this place had because i actually really enjoyed myself here we came here for the happy hour on a thursday after a failed attempt at m s and were really glad we did i haven't been here since they changed owners but i definitely like the vibe and decor better all drinks are half off from 5-8pm everyday also i tried their pulled-pork sandwich a recommendation from our really nice waitress and thought it was pretty awesome better than other typical bar food and it was quite tender i wouldn't recommend getting the tacos 2 albeit tasty since the price wasn't worth the quantity it was fun times grabbing a beer and relaxing to some random sports news on the many lcd tv's definitely will come back 
we were walking to frenchman street to hear some live music and struck up a conversation with a local along the way who recommended that we check out bmc after stopping in at a couple of other clubs we heeded his advice and are glad we did great blues band the night we were there with several people sitting in for a few songs apiece peter d summed it up well earlier the drinks were cheap the crowd was moving the bartender was sweet and life was good to top it off i accidentallly gave the bartender a ten and one when tippiping for a drink and she brought me the ten back saying i think you made a mistake 
i take my german shepherd to this vet i took her for her annual exam my granddaughter who is 3 came with me she brought her baby doll and asked the dr to look at her dr velotta was awesome she listened to the dolls chest and said yes i think does need some medicine she let the room and the assistant came in with a dropper and a little bottle of medicine -cough medicine- give every day with love i was so appreciative theat they went the extra mile my dog reyna is always treated well at this office yes they may be a bit more expensive that some other vets but i believe that you get what you pay for evidenced by my visit yesterday 
i've gone to new deck more than a handful of times and everytime i go it gets slightly more disappointing i remember the first time i went and i had the grilled cheese i thought it was the best thing in the world everytime i've had it since then has not been close i'm a vegetarian and have eaten everything on the menu i can expect for the pasta everything has been good but i've always had better and the other reviews are right you could go at the same time every time you go and it could be empty one time and packed the next i never understood alas i'll probably be going there again so we'll see if its bounced back in my months away 
we had a party of six service was slow which was odd since the restaurant was 25 full looking to indulge in our favorites raw oysters cheesy grits shrimp shrimp parm shrimp scampi shrimp po-boy grouper po-boy gator bites disappointed with rick's service our order was input wrong twice so one of our party settled for the mix up and the other party waited no apology or real explanation for the mistake it required zero effort on rick's part simple common courtesy is easy and goes a long way it's a must in the food service industry some servers forget that customers actually come to their business to pay for a prepared meal and should be treated accordingly this family run business might rethink a customer service refresher course how can it hurt 
always great service and great food friendly people a true gem 
i love taking my family and friends to this place they make it easy to get set up and provide a rental golf cart guns and any other gear you may need to rent you can buy ammo ahead of time or boxes there there's also snacks and drinks and a small cantina with burgers dogs for purchase the course is well displayed to maneuver and instructions at each post on where the discs are coming from i also have a great time and everyone i have brought loves it too highly recommend if you enjoy the outdoors and shooting flying objects 
really love everything about this place the staff is always friendly willing to help the wegman products are very reasonably priced great the bakery is great for birthday cakes everyone comments at our parties how much they love the cakes 
great food friendly and knowledgeable staff clean environment good selection of local beer - what more could you ask for i had the pork belly steamed bun which was very tender and delicious and the mushroom dumplings which were also good tried some of my friend's beet home fries and they were interesting and yummy everyone enjoyed their food and our server was extremely helpful with his suggestions when we asked the bathrooms are very spacious and clean there is limited seating so this place probably wouldn't be good for a big group i will definitely be back 
this is a super fry's i wish they all could be like this or that it wasn't so darn far away this store has way more choices to offer than many of the fry's in the tucson area i went on a super busy day today being christmas eve and everyone was still very nice and helpful even under all the stress of the holiday it's a nice clean well organized store 
great place for a family dinner or a first date prices are reasonable wine list is good and service was excellent 
this thai restaurant does everything right crispy spring rolls served with a delicious sauce coconut chicken soup that is full of flavor and tofu in chili sauce that is perfectly spicy but not hot the amazing chicken entree is yummy too the service is friendly fast and efficient you will love the food atmosphere and service i'll return often 
a very nice albeit average slice five points' location on charlotte is a recently opened store in a new facility it's well decorated active space the service is dependable and the bar is above par and the food isn't bad it's just not unique and not above average in taste it's the kind of average pizza you'll find in your average pizza parlor meh 
the customer service is what makes this tijuana flats stand out it happens from the minute you walk in where you are greeted by someone who gives you the rundown on how their menu works to the manager coming around near the end of your meal to make sure everything is delicious and going well at your table ordering is three steps 1 choose your entree 2 choose your meat 3 choose your toppings everything is made to order nothing is frozen or microwaved there are specials on tijuana tuesdaze 2 tacos chips a drink on throwback thursday's a burrito chips drink both specials are 5 99 of course there are nachos quesadillas salads and more to choose from for my quesadilla i chose blackened chicken chips and a drink for 7 79 i thought the price point was a little high for what you get you can also add rice beans to that for more my chicken was of good quality but the blackening wasn't that sharp bite of heat i expect and the quesadilla itself had too little chicken my friend had the crispy baja street fish tacos the fish was not up to high standards basically it wasn't fresh the manager noticed her plate wasn't touched and was very nice about it not only did he offer to comp her meal when he returned her money he also brought her a 'gratis' warm dessert flautas to take home you can't get customer service any better than that i would go back to try other things on the menu perhaps the specials are the way to go next time 76 100
brides do not waste your money here do not waste one moment of your time energy or cash at bridaltown this is not a review about the decor choices or the aesthetics of bridaltown that shouldn't matter anyway as long as there is a basic level of customer service and decency shown to those who have paid good money in exchange for your services that does not exist at bridaltown i live on the west coast but wanted to buy my wedding dress in the east since that's where i'm getting married i went to bridaltown at the end of december when they had some kind of sale going on so i got the dress which is made in china for them at a slightly discounted rate that they said would only be good for that week side note while we were there the power kept going out repeatedly ever try on wedding dresses in the dark they said the dress had to be ordered and would be in by may which worked fine for me because i planned to be in town at the end of june for a week in order to leave plenty of time for my first alterations for my september 1st wedding may came and went and there was no dress my mother called every few days to see where the dress was nobody knew and nobody offered her help or went out of their way to take care of a customer who'd paid well over 1500 for their product finally the dress arrived four days before i was flying east they had ordered the wrong dress when my mother said that's not the dress the saleswoman accused her of not knowing what the dress even looked like it turned out our original saleswoman had wrote in the wrong dress number and apparently there's no kind of system to doublecheck the order she just handwrote it in once and that was it my mom asked for the owner who when he finally came out yelled at her until she cried waving around my signed receipt saying he didn't need to get her the dress until 30 weeks after ordering it 30 weeks is 7 1 2 months which is an absurdly long amount of time especially when we were told when i ordered it that it would only be 5 months but apparently it was somehow our fault my sister then called the owner william titze who behaved appallingly to her as well screaming over her on the phone and refusing to even apologize for the mix-up how is this man in the wedding business she finally got him to agree to send me the dress when it came in to los angeles where i live so i could get it altered there and then reimburse the cost to send it to rochester ny where i'm getting married when i called mr titze the next morning i could barely get a word in edgewise i'm not even saying that this man is a talker he literally would scream over my words when i tried to say anything he never apologized for the mistake on their part he never offered to help in anyway he never even attempted to work with me he just yelled at me the person who spent their hard-earned money at his horrific business screaming that he had 30 weeks 30 weeks 30 weeks to get me the dress it was as if i was the one who had written down the wrong dress and he was the one who was owed something then he had the nerve to say he was disappointed in my sister who was supposed to email him my address the night before and how dare i have other people talk to him like my mother and sister who were trying to protect me because his contract is with me the bride as i tried to get him to verbally agree that he would get my the dress he just shouted over me until i finally just screamed back at him and furious and shaking told him his error was wasting my entire trip back to pa to get this dress and try it on he didn't even listen he finally was just screaming at me so loudly and so stubbornly i hung up on him and cried i have never been treated so callously and offensively by someone whose services i paid for when i emailed him my address and a transcript of what we discussed i'm not sure how much of a discussion it could be with him yelling over my voice he wrote back to say that he refused to reimburse me to ship the dress from la to rochester like he had told my sister after consulting with a lawyer i decided to drop it because this man is sick there is no way to talk with him no way to work with him at all and honestly i just couldn't get back on the phone with him he shipped the dress usps and it arrived not on july 28th when he said it would but july 30th at this point i'd like to never think about william titze and bridaltown ever again but i absolutely hate the thought of any other bride giving this man any of her money please please please do not support this business they take your payment and then treat their customers like dirt a wedding is supposed to be a happy wonderful time of life but planning the big day is difficult enough without an unprofessional incredibly rude and shamefully indecent business treating you so horrifyingly bad 
amazing service and the shrimp and grits are amongst the best i've ever had fairly new location but definitely personifies st pete's food scene at its best nice open bar w in and out seating and several stylish gathering areas all in all a good vibes and excellent kitchen kinda place and will be a regular stop for me when visiting 
you tell them guy with the dreds medium rare and he still burns the burger a little past well done i'm done ordering food from this place i've been coming here since 2005 it's a recurring problem how do you not know how to cook a burger wtf 
i was excited to try this place while visiting tucson after reading the other glowing reviews it had been a long day of travel up at 4 15a eastern in order to make it to the airport so i was ready for some good food before crashing we started with the tamarindo - a sweet slightly citrusy beverage which was very syrupy and concentrated - better when diluted with ice the salsa and chips really whetted my appetite - nice and spicy salsa and thick crunchy chips i started with the media lunas - delicious tortillas filled with veggies and fried with cooked tomatoes on top bob started with the pupusas mixtas and seemed to enjoy them very much i opted for the pork mole everything seemed so varied and delicious by the descriptions that i really got my hopes up however after getting our dishes and seeing the others around the room there seemed to be a recurring theme meat covered in sauce with black beans rice and lettuce the sides were all on the dry side casualty of the climate so they appeared to try to make up for it by covering the meat in sauce my pork was literally swimming in sauce but instead of being tender it was more like it had been stewed into submission - it was soft and dry and somewhat fatty and didn't seem to have flavor itself the mole itself was more sweet than spicy so not my favorite as i watched the veggie plate walk by i was wishing i ordered it the service was friendly and i liked the laid-back feel as we were walking out the place was filling up perhaps guatemalan just isn't for me 
went here for the second time and was very pleased with my experience the service was great crystal was an amazing server i had a hard time choosing what i wanted to eat and she gave me so many different options of what i should eat i ended up getting a greek salad and it was delicious 
just realized i left my review on the wrong mosiac oh how i love tapa bars i asked one of my friends that moved here from nebraska do you want to go get tapas sarah did you just say you want to go get topless oh it's a running joke now in our friendship anytime we go to mosiac let's see a couple of my favorite tapas truffled frites- the parmesan and smoked garlic aioli sauce makes this melt in my mouth ahi tuna tartar is a favorite of mine at any place that offers it i think it's super citrusy at mosiac i do like the grass fed tenderloin too it's really juicy and cooked just right drinks belvederetini is my favorite it's absolutely beautiful champagne bellini is usually a favorite of mine there was something just off about the one here i think it maybe there was too much orange juice in mine mango love is a very fruity type drink i love mango so i just had to try it i tried their bloody mary and i wasn't a fan they had way too much worchestershire sauce in it the ambience of this place is awesome you can go and sit on the patio on a nice breezy day or dress up and be sexy on the bar side it's great for any date 
this review is for com walmart com ships from multiple warehouses and is a mess order comes various times and needed to call 3x while it's free it's not in anyway friendly or easy will not use again
do they purposely try to mess up your order every single time i've gone here they messed something up every single time i only go back because it's a block away from home but the convenience isn't even worth the hassle 
conveniently located right across the street from our hotel i stopped in to grab a quick lunch before a wedding that we were attending at the four seasons biltmore hotel that afternoon i totally forgot that we had eaten at saigon noodle house over six years ago the restaurant was very busy on sunday for lunch and similar to six years ago plenty of customers but lots of dirty tables our order was to go so instead of getting pho we opted for the dry vermicelli plates the combo grilled pork chop grilled shrimp and egg roll with veggies and vermicelli was excellent huge portions for 9 95 since this order was for take out they did inform me it would take 20 minutes to prepare plenty of parking in the shopping center lot some construction on the shopping center property made it hard to get in and out 
what else do you do in the midwest other than chow down on some good ole bbq pappy's was our first stop after landing at the airport staff was welcoming with some southern hospitality the ambiance was patriotic family oriented and just straight up fun take a minute to look around at the pictures knick knacks pappy's paraphernalia the pig and go find that smoker we were ready to hoedown toto i've a feeling we're not in california anymore so here's the gist stand in line think about your order long lines but they move fast flat screens with sports games showing go clippers this is your year follow the rules and do not save tables order 1st then the host will find a table for you we went pig wild and decided to try everything we wanted c'mon now how often do we get to experience bbq at a real smokehouse our faves were -burnt ends 13 95 w 2 sides it is what it is the burnt ends similar to the brisket in texture but packed with flavor seasoning glaze adult favorite -dry-rubbed slow smoked over apple cherry wood house special st louis ribs 23 99 for full slab 2 sides nicely seasoned and somewhat fall off the bone a tad dry kid's favorite -fried corn on a cob smoky kernels w a hint of salt yum kid's didn't like it -baked beans plumped beans in a sweet savory bbq sauce w garlic delicious -holly's hot sauce texas style hot won our hearts a little tang kick and sweetness gotta admit we expected more from their spicy sausage they were light in color and lacked the glaze we've grown accustomed to plus it wasn't very smoky or as spicy as we hoped brisket was juicy but definitely needed to be paired with the bbq sauces i love it when i'm travelling and actually feel like i'm in a different place pappy's was the highlight of our trip yummy food and enjoyable vibe a must when in st louis p s check out the bacon soda and man vs food pix enjoy 
the movers were on time and worked very efficiently and quickly it was a good price and good work i would recommend them in the future to anyone doing a local move 
lucky's is one of the last places in the santa barbara area that still does abalone and they do it right just like in the old days where it's cooked just like a flank steak i've never tried anything else here other than drinks some shrimp which is all great very small but cozy place and you always seem to see local friends here though i did trip on the ledge with a full drink in my hands and almost spilled it all over my friend but luckily i got cat like speed and reflexes and caught myself a bit embarrassing to stumble like this without even taking a sip of my first drink but no one laughed too hard and the staff was very concerned and nice to check in on me 
this meal delivery was a great experience i did not get ill i have a number of food allergies and my family and i loved each menu option it is great to have food portioned out for you and easily prepared especially during the busy holiday season i will not only order again from grateful plate i will be spreading my love and devotion to this team for years to come keep up the awesome work grateful plate team the menu is local seasonal and organic where possible thank you 
food is amazing i haven't tried anything that i didn't like everyone that works there is super friendly and they basically have my order memorized when i go in there definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking to get a good salad or a flatbread their juices are awesome too the hyde park hangover and the orange pineapple kale are my go-tos
i give them dirty stuff i come back in a day or so and they give me clean stuff in return for no issues even if a little pricey and here is their strong point great customer service with a actually friendly smile yep they get to keep my business 
sign on the door says buy a drink and make us the best moe's in town i assumed i would get excellent service if you have a gluten allergy don't ask the folks behind the counter if they have gluten free tortillas cause you will get a exhaustive eye roll and an allergy list tossed carelessly in your general direction walking into a taco joint and asking for a burrito sans gluten is a little ridiculous sounding i get it but in this day in age they do exist so i can ask without making me feel like an idiot i love moe's i have been a fan for years blonde haired chick morgan working the chip station has completely ruined it for me won't go to this location again 
i wanted a fine dining experience in new orleans and was between commander's palace and august i am so glad i chose august my favorite dishes of the night included the gnocchi agnolotti and foie gras the market vegetable degustation didn't wow me but the three appetizers were so absolutely delicious that i would go back in a heartbeat this is what i would expect from a john besh restaurant 
just excellent the service is superior and the seats are sublime i had the seared tuna entr e and i was pleasantly surprised the dish was fresh properly prepared and indeed as advertised sushi grade this is the only theater i will visit from here on 
we went there based on positive reviews they positive reviews had to come from tipsy people the waiter was very nice and helpful positive so far the ice tea was perfection score then the food came my best burger ever turned out to be this little burger covered in bbq sauce hidden by an onion ring the fries were twice cooked cook here this happens when the fries are cold and they re-fry to warm them all it does is make them dark greasy and crispy aka burnt no matter how much garlic salt you put on them there was a lot they won't taste like fresh not worth the 18 bucks my husband ordered wings 16 dollars for 8 wings and 2 limp carrots 1 soda and 1 ice tea 9 each a very expensive lunch save money go to jack in the box and get better food very disappointing 
the food here is amazing i live in atlanta and i swear on my kids i literally drive to new orleans just to eat at this restaurant there is nothing like it in the world i recently seen a post on facebook about the owner who is always so nice and accommodating to my family when we come in because he knows we drive all the way from atlanta just to eat making someone pay their bill and now everyone want to jump on her bandwagon well let me just say that she made a big deal out of nothing she ordered drinks and had to pay for them well wopty do you had to pay for something that you ordered don't listen to this hater trust if you go there once you will be hooked for life like i am
had the iced cafe mocha and definitely worth a repeat visit wonderful little breakfast sandwiches i wasn't expecting much from them but the biscuits were great and the eggs and sausage were good as well i tried the muffins and such and those were great warmed up as well overall great place for a quick coffee stop or to go in the back have a cup and look at some artwork
horrible customer service i was returning a pants a stylish pants with very good quality but petite size and asked for if they can give me a bag to carry my other stuffs the employee said that i have to purchase something in order to get a bag i was not coming to the store to ask for a bag i was very unhappy about their attitude my sister found one shirt and one skirt that she likes but we decided to purchase in other stores because of their attitude i will not come back to this store in the future 
went here the day after i cracked my phone then they told me it would take about 10 minutes took a little over 30 the guy who did my phone was very nice and he hooked it up with the discounts but my phone is still broken it's been in my life proof case since i fixed it and i haven't dropped it once but it's still being glitchy and unresponsive 
breakfast cuban was borderline inedible portion sizes were inadequate and the staff was unconscionably rude giving them the benefit of the doubt as this was my first visit that maybe i just had a fluke experience but i'm also not feeling inclined to return and test the theory 
it's amazing when a cafe can't even make a half decent coffee we had the smoked salmon and eggs far too sweet and why packed with dill sauce to the point where you couldn't even taste the salmon what ever happened to keeping it simple 
old school steak house i only visited for a drink which was a margarita and it was very good not too tangy like some i've had i had already eaten but the food on other plates looked amazing prime rib is their specialty the onion rings were huge and heaped high in a pile meals were a bit pricy but probably commensurate with the food quality next time i will eat 
flu shot time the last shot i had here it took 2 hours this time i called and asked what is the best time to come in recommendation is before 10 am igot there at 830 am only saw 3 customers while i was there i was out in 40 min 
this is the worst checkers i've ever been to i've dealt with the same lady at the window 3-4 times now and she is so incredibly rude we went to get ice cream stackers and it was melted so badly that it was thinner then a milkshake so we called and the manager said she would take care of it the next time we came in well when we went in the lady at the window was so rude when i told her what happened and that the manager said she'd fix it so i asked to speak to the manager and she told me that she was busy and we'd have to talk to her next time ummmm what our food is always wrong in some way and idk why we keep trying it just keeps getting worse and the woman at the window is constantly with a horrible attitude we are done trying with this place 
i used to really love mofoco but i guess that's when it was called monon food company ever since they've changed their brand it's just really meh my family went out to dinner and brought our little dog they get a for allowing little iggy to sit outside with us however it took my mother going inside to the host stand for us to get seated after someone said that they would be right back to seat us scratches head ok the menu has changed and not for the better they've eliminated a lot of stuff and unless i need to get new glasses after getting new glasses last month i didn't see a single sandwich option on the menu aside from burgers we ordered and finally our food came after a long wait my burger was really good but damn did those fries suck it was like i ordered a side of seasoning with a dash of fries my sister and wife ordered a side of fries and they weren't completely cooked my wife also ordered the meatloaf sliders and they didn't look like meatloaf all in all i've experienced worse from other places but i've experienced better at monon food company and with all the changes i don't know if i'll be back 
this was an experience i arrive before they opened and arrived to a line outside waiting to get in the food was good not great ut we did enjoy what we ordered the service was poor i had to stand up twice to ask for drink refills part of my order was not included so i just said forget it 
china kitchen is now down to one star pretty sad luncheon specials are now w down to half the size they used to be it appears it is under new management very sad end of an era i'm downgrading my review from 5 stars to 2 stars every time i come in here i get scowled at by the lady behind the counter look i know you hate your life but i am the customer this means smiling this means greeting me the food is ok but to be honest it's not that great and they are getting more expensive want a better review smile at me be nice to me or i'm going someplace else there are now other choices 
came with great expectation only to come up not enough at all this place supposed to be huge no you want huge go to grand china near franklin mills one food just regular any other chinese buffet out there nothing special at all there's a huge banner of 'hibachi and grill no extra charge' in the back are you for real hibachi and grill always no extra charge in any other chinese buffet out there and surprisingly a lot of people fall for this and start freaking lines to wait for hibachi only in jersey eh there's a long ass line just to get fruits are you serious there's a long ass line just to get cooked meat and noodles aka hibachi are you serious there's a freaking long ass line just to get ice cream now you've gotta be kidding right no they're not dirty floor around the ice cream section like chocolate and strawberry syrup just fell and everybody don't care enough and start stepping and smearing the whole frigging thing stupid dim light with fancy red blue green color seat that isn't comfy at all you literally able to feel the other dude back when he lean so freaking deep like come on dude i know you felt mine too no homo and you gonna be so rude and not care about it and top of that you were talking and laughing so hard about your stupid topic on stinky y seriously me and parents had enough of this place they charge us for a freaking hot tea this is not even come close to minado and they charge us for a hot tea 1 for a cup one freaking dollar for a cup i don't know about you but at buffet you charge the drink only if we order sodas not for water and not for hot tea - especially per cup unless you are at minado which is totally an exception oh and things got 'better' we paid the food 9 person tax 1 person hot tea 4 toll we immediately bounce without leaving tips now i don't know about you but i feel that i don't have to leave a tip at a place especially if i'm not satisfied at all and i didn't even bring gazillion people with me mom and i start moving out quickly since we had enough dad was following behind us but a waiter stop him asking for a tip seriously this is not a freaking chinatownnnnn wtf is this bullcrap a waiter asking for a freaking tip from a party of 3 at chinese buffet so dad was pissed and throw a dollar at her i know restaurants at chinatown begging for tips but for a buffet though never heard of until yesterday oh yes we will not be returning ever for the price that close to 13 per person we'd rather go to grand china buffet for our buffet fix at franklin mills mall bigger more varieties of food no line for fruits no line for ice cream no line for hibachi and they got lobster crab etc for dinner 
had a great day in santa barbara until we arrived at andersons poor slow service after waiting for awhile we decided to just head back to our hotel room and order room service instead our room service was great btw 
the staff here is generally helpful and friendly they work hard and always willing to help the store is clean and very spacious i have donated here a lot over the years since living right around the corner 2015 i have gotten a couple things here even just to go in and look around is always a good experience definitely worth at least checking out 
food was pretty good but consistent with other reviews didn't come out hot the wait for food is way too long i asked for a different hot sauce was told what options there were and asked for one and nothing ever came just like there being no normal sugar on our table i had to go get the sugar and hot sauce from another table 
always happy coming here friendly staff great food and coffee they have a rewards program as well the quiches are delicious definitely pick this place over the coffee chains 
i wavered between 3 and 4 stars the food was very good but the service was very slow even to acknowledge that we were sitting in the restaurant if you're not in a hurry or even in a normal you may well enjoy the food but bring someone to talk to or a sunday paper tablet phone etc 
i was in oro valley to see family i wanted to make a side trip to biosphere 2 and was alone at lunch something drew me to this place i rolled the dice i had 2 carne asato tacos with rice frijoles refritos the rice was light fluffy a flavorful the frijoles were perfect my tacos were huge i didn't eat dinner that night i loved the salsa bar jalepenos escabeche were perfect i'll be back 
just chatting away ignoring patrons i don't feel like i should have to raise my voice to get your attention to get another beer or give me my check waited 20 minutes and finally walked around the bar to ask for my check 
wonderful customer service the team was energetic and welcoming they made conversation with everyone and provided excellent customer service remade a pizza that was barely messed up without being asked-just because it was the right thing food was hot and quite tasty loved it 
always a great time food is amazing atmosphere is perfect i just wish i had better friends to share it with 
ricky and company are awesome correct every time right on the money trustworthy and deliver on time when they say wont go anywhere else 
latest visit to mo's 10 15 19 i went to get my free poke bowl that i earned through the their restaurant only to find out that my free entree expired 10 1 so bummed i made 10 purchases and load my reward the lady at the counter said they expire pretty quickly my poke bowl was good but the fish wasn't very cold they have also added extra charges for more than 2 sauces avocado and no longer have the free sauces in their dispensers they now also make you write your order down and take a number to have your order brought out to you i really like watching my order assembled to make sure i get what i want they have also added different food options burgers flatbreads to their menu ________________________ best poke in town my boys and i have been here twice and love it i strayed and went to jimmy's pita and poke and was extremely unhappy - i won't ever again bowls aren't bowls they are very large square takeout boxes fish is always on point staff is very friendly and will make suggestions and walk u thru the options they also have a sauce station that has eel sauce spicy mayo soy ginger and siracha sauces for no extra charge huge avocados and very fresh veggies 
came for sunday brunch with no reservation and was seated promptly at a window very nice table food was amazing service was exceptional this place is a hidden gym and has some of the most quality food in the city don't miss out
worst steak ever offered me a 10 dollar discount fries ice cold manager no help done with this restaurant 
i have lived in or around zionsville for many years the friendly is a center stage of the downtown community most of the time i need to order takeout for my team they are always so kind on the telephone and the orders are done correctly we love the food - it is such a great treat when we get to eat at the friendly in zionsville in
i have been attending the university for 5 years now and i just recently learnt about this place last semester i absolutely love this place the individual size pizza is filling with the thick and crispy crust i've only tried the bulgogi pizza and it is always tasty and made fresh it is now my go-to for a quick bite whenever i need to grab lunch 
do not leave anything in your vehicle unless you don't mind if it gets stolen we took our vehicle there for an oil change and the technicians rummaged through our console they stole pain medication that was prescribed for a recent knee replacement a police report was filed the manager claims to have dealt with the technicians involved but this whole experience has been a nightmare it really shouldn't take a dozen emails to get a response to my complaints the manager ignored my email for 18 days when he finally responded he refused to make this right so basically i paid his store money to violate my privacy and steal from me the least he could have done is refund my money as a show of good will at this point it is the principle of the matter he was willing to punish the technicians but not make things right with the customer that his employees wronged please do not use this store i believe we as a community have a duty to share our experience in order to save others from having the same thing happen to them i am so upset by the treatment i received at this store that i will continue to spread the word don't take the risk the owners at this store have proven by their actions or rather lack thereof that having a good reputation in the community means nothing the bottomline is more important than righting a wrong and for that reason it is my hope that you would take your business elsewhere 
this was the first time we ever tried this pet hotel it's the only one we've ever needed to use we have a one year old adorable cat he's very affectionate and loves attention when i saw the cat house i was really upset at first because it was a bunch of cages we were glad we picked the townhouse option for our cat because it was the largest space available they were very accommodating about his food because we feed him a specific diet we had no issues with check in and check out they are reasonably priced i'm not sure we'd ever use this place again just because of how small of an establishment is i think we just expected a little more 
just returned from another fantastic experience having my car repaired by bill nocella auto body many great shops in south philly but bill has customer service that is head and shoulders above most body shops reattached one of my rubber bumper protectors at not charge always walk away with a peaceful feeling 
we loved this place we ordered the breakfast combo because we wanted to try a little bit of everything the hot fries were my favorite and the apple cinnamon stuffed french toast was perfect for my sweet tooth the manager fuad was friendly he made us feel welcomed and he stopped by our table to check on us before paying our bill our waiter was very nice and the atmosphere was very relaxing we look forward to returning again 
we brought a group of nine boats through philly on our way up the coast we were told that buddakan was high on the list of excellent restaurants buddakan did not disappoint one of the best restaurants we've eaten at in a few weeks excellent mood perfect lighting with low conversation noise perfect wait staff and unbelievable food wonderful dining experience we will definitely be back and oh my the wasabi mashed potatoes to die for 
there are a lot of ice cream shops in this area but give this one a try it's a little shop but it draws big crowds a really nice family runs it try the cookie monster ice cream - it's like a blue cookie dough 
i remember the day the vet imploded i was fascinated because i'm crazy and sad because i'm emotional but as an eagles fan i can honestly say it's replacement done good lincoln financial field better known as the linc is a football lover's paradise truthfully there's not a bad seat in the house and a ticket can be purchased at just about any monetary comfort level they've even got standing room which can be a lot like concert-going except you're above the stage i'm a seasoned tailgater jetro lot if you must know so it's rare that i get inside the stadium without a few drinks in me i suppose pigs were flying last sunday or the eagles were playing the colts and i had to catch a glimpse of my man peyton manning because i passed through the gates sober and found headhouse plaza a calmed down version of what was happening outside the fence - band food beer shopping it was kinda cool we headed to the field the interior gates open about 1 5 hours before kickoff to watch the fellas warm up the usher was super sweet and let me down to gawk at peyton he's invited to our wedding i assured him prices on food and bev are sky high but that's pretty standard for sports arenas not a great selection either the linc needs to take a lesson from citizen's bank park and get some better stuff in here the beer ushers aren't as quick either quick tip philly fans are as aggressive as you hear be prepared 
had heard great things so was very disappointed when our experience turned turn out so poorly waiting patiently for their famous pretzel bread and our salads we were surprised when they brought our main course two out of three sides were wrong my husband's meat combo was missing the ribs my filet was to be medium rare and came out butterflied to a 1 4 thick and medium the waiter and then the manager kept pushing for us to have free desserts we aren't dessert people to begin with and dessert couldn't begin to make up for the disappointment we received a reduction in the bill which covered my botched steak 
great spot on the boardwalk at johns pass super friendly waitress quick meal awesome fries 
i didn't have to make a reservation it's hard to find this place inside the big mall but they were so kind enough to give me directions twice over the phone they were quick with the service kind of too quick so you'll be in and out of the place fast real good pro about zara is that they accept credit card for a 10service but if you are tipping them on your card make sure to tell them before they swipe your card 
hmmm i was very surprised to see all the low ratings on cardwell's my friends and i dined there last night as part of clayton restaurant week remy's was our first choice but we couldn't get reservations on such short notice so cardwell's it was none of us were disappointed in the food or the service i had the beef carpaccio for an appetizer i was actually a little shocked at how many slices of beef were on the plate and so beautifully presented with a crisp cucumber rolled salad in the middle crispy capers and shaved parmesan my entree was the braised short ribs which was actually a very sizable portion of a rib cooked to falling off the bone perfection and served with yukon mashed potatoes braised red cabbage and spaghetti squash i had enough for leftovers and chose that route to save room for dessert i'm glad i did dessert was described as a chocolate pate with exotic fruit coulis i couldn't picture what that was in my head but what came to the table was total deliciousness 3 triangles of dark decadent fudge slices with a mango raspberry puree and fresh whipped cream and strawberries perfect with my cabernet i see one complaint in other reviews that also prevented me from giving 5 stars my friend ordered the filet and i was expecting a nicely seared chunk of filet to the table what she got looked like it was a poorly cut piece of meat and didn't look that appetizing she let me taste it and although it was good and she was completely happy with it i can't justify a perfect meal it was close though 
i got married here three days ago and could not wait to tell the world about the magical experience we had at cafe amelie from our first visit danny and his attentive staff made sure that our experience was handled with care and confidence putting together a wedding can be stressful especially if you aren't a wedding-y type of bride or groom but every single detail went smoothly even details i didn't know about until later guests raved about the food crab cakes shrimp and grits ftw the ambiance truly gorgeous courtyard and the staff danny is seriously the man and even tricky little elements were smoothed with drama-free professionalism if you are looking for the best place for a meal in the french quarter or to hold a private event well stop looking and head to the dreamy oasis that is cafe amelie my new husband and i look forward to future anniversary dinners here also check out their sister restaurant petite amelie for a more casual but equally delightful lunch or snack if you are in a hurry 
when it comes to subs and nippers corner eateries i've never gotten into the jersey mike's fad and ordering at schlotszky's can be a nightmare enter subway my hero get it okay i digress of all the subways i've been to in south nash this one is by far the cleanest and has by far the friendliest staff yes the old sandwich artist is slowish and the family who operates this location are not us born but this is a crappy economy don't we all need jobs as for lack of ingredients on-hand what can i say i'm a creature of habit i like what i like and without fail i always order a veggie delight on wheat with provolone lettuce tomatoes cucumbers green peppers black olives oil vinegar with a dash of oregano they're never out of any of those shrug they always oblige when i ask for extra black olives and if i catch the owner at checkout he almost always gives me free cookies three stars for a good ol' neighborhood sub shop and an extra one for the haters 
the hotel modern is a holiday inn express there are several chains like hi best western etc with multiple locations throughout nola so to avoid confusion many have another name they go by the front side of the hotel faces a traffic circle formerly known as lee circle with a little park in it the view from the front of the hotel is this lovely empty pedestal formerly home to a historic figure who became politically incorrect but still a pretty little park there are a few homeless sleeping here at night and a few hang out throughout the neighborhood during the day they didn't seem to bother anyone the hotel is on the st charles trolley line we walked the neighborhood at night there is a tiny gas station convenience store open late the only other thing open late within 3 blocks was the flamingo-a-go-go bar grill with very good food drinks worth the 3-block walk for sure see my review for more info about the room we stayed in 1003 a king room on floor 10 newly renovated everything was new modern super clean bathroom large with built-in nightlight hairdryer no shower huge walk-in no tub bed comfortable semi-firm pillows 4 provided plush -soft but resilient not sure if memory foam climate control working thermostat in room controlled the temp comfortably closet yes but small chairs 1 desk chair 1 upholstered chair windows have sheer blackout shades outlets usb and standard on both side tables and by desk standard plug in bathroom also amenities room has - flat tv with cable decent of channels mini fridge keurig with pods cream sugar packets lobby has- a serving room for breakfast all-day coffee tea bar with liquid coffee mate creamer two generous seating areas in open floor plan between lobby breakfast room business bar with outlets there was also a small sundries shop in the lobby it has some snacks and toiletries also basic first aid such as aspirin antacids i think signs indicated a cafe and a gym i didn't use either on my short stay but the gym looked well-equipped parking idk we came in by rail and uber-ed the 2 miles to from the train station you could probably walk it if you travel light but we had suitcases location middle of the french quarter convenient within blocks to- port of nola for cruise ships the french market lafayette square bourbon st the superdome tulane med ctr the wwii museum ogden museum of southern art this was a great choice of hotels we would definitely stay here again this review is cross-posted to the holiday inn express 936 st charles ave nola 
you know that little hole in the wall place you've always wanted to try as you pass it by on the way to work t b is just that type of place reminiscent of the small bodegas in boston and nyc you can tell the clientele is consistent and fiercely loyal and with good reason this place rocks the po-boy the roast beef-gravy ratio is stellar the slightest mention of tender cooked so they flavor but are not prominent onions in the gravy lend just the right amount of flavor the bread has just the right amount of chewy inside to slightly resistant crust texture ratio yes my friend this place is awesome on par and in many ways surpassing the overpriced po-boy shops of uptown this hidden gem on jeff hwy is one not to miss and the french fries with roast beef gravy and cheese man such amazing flavor texture and value at this price point take the small drive and check this place out you'll be glad you did 
ultimately i'm unhappy because the product quality or application quality is terrible customer service is decent and the initial outcome of my nails was great by day two 6 of my acrylics were already lifting i've been getting acrylic nails for 13 years and this would have to be the first time i've had lifting next day i'm sure if i were to go back they'd find a way to say it was something i'd done to cause it so i won't even bother didn't have high expectations anyway just based on the location and general demographic 
love love love the tacos and the vibe this place has definitely get your tacos blackened style i wish i could have sat here all day 
rolled through for a little tuesday happy hour action love sitting outside soaking up rays and sipping drinks plenty of both here the drinks here are great chris our bartender gave us the whole low down pretty quickly well drinks are 1 75 draught beer like yuengling or miller light is 1 50 during happy hour i was blown away when they had my favorite beer hell or high watermelon on tap big points for that pineapple express margarita was excellent as was a virgin pina colada the food is where this place was lacking on tuesday they offer a 1 dollar chowder which came out luke warm and not very good coconut shrimp app was severely overcooked fried pickles were good onion rings which happened to be complimentary for yelpers was the star of everything tasty batter and a nice remoulade come for the drinks and you'll walk away happy 
the other beignet spot with a little less fanfare and shorter lines but equally good didn't want to stand in the cold rainy weather on the gloomy sunday morning at the other beignet spot so we opted for cafe beignet and they didn't disappoint fresh hot and soft beignet's out the fryer what could be better in this weather i only wish the coffee was a tad bit hotter i like my joe pipping hot otherwise a perfect way to start the day in new orleans 
ozone pig although i had heard of this place i am now a true fan after eating here the ribs are soooooo goooood 
we are new to the area we are living in our rv here for 2 months and needed a bbq fix grub hub made it here to the park which we found had no gps sorry the bbq pork ribs were still warm and smokey tasting delicious the beef brisket was moist and flavorful a little fatty but don't let you stop from ordering big hunks i recommend highly ps i enjoyed the sauce not too sweet and little kick amazing
i'm biased i was here almost every weekend while in college the guinness is always flowing the crowd is fantastic never saw a fight ever and it likely possesses the best jukebox in northern nevada i've spent a lot of time in a lot of bars in reno and corrigan's remains my favorite it's like a comfortable pair of shoes not the prettiest but it just feels right 
i love me some pho and i love me some burrito this combination fusion is a tick tick tick booooooooom bomb in your mouth service is friendly and made to order definitely a recommend if you are in the neighborhood don't just eat good eat well 
great place for groups in the city everyone loved their dishes i recommend trying one of their spicy cocktails 
we live out of town and hired jeff and his team to paint our home they did not disappoint great communication completed the job on time and delivered a quality product the house looks great and the price was very reasonable jeff kept us informed along the way they cleaned up after the job was completed a very professional job all the way around give them a try you won't be disappointed 
manhattan deli is a great choice for lunch at atlantis i've been here twice now and both times we left happy with our meals and service the portions are huge and definitely enough to share they even split the portions for you my boyfriend and i get the double decker pastrami and corned beef sandwich i recommend you get it toasted as the meat is steaming hot the fries and potato salad are both good we've had the latkes also and they are perfectly crispy on the edges yum our most recent waitress kellee was very friendly and attentive i would recommend and return 
this is the best shoe boutique ever we must be solemates spelling intended as i really have a thing for shoes that make a statement i wish i lived in new orleans or maybe not - i'd be there every week buying shoes 
the quesadilla was delicious they make it with an awesome garlic sauce the decor and atmosphere were weird but the staff was friendly 
we recently purchased a vehicle from champion chrysler with jason armstrong's assistance purchasing a new vehicle can be a stressful ordeal however with jason's help it was quite an enjoyable experience jason gave us the most impressive customer service he took the time to listen to our needs and wants and recommended the perfect vehicle - all without the typical high-pressure techniques used by the average car salesman we will definitely recommend jason and champion chrysler to all of our family and friends kudos jason 
i really can't describe how bad this food was we are not picky eaters and for two teenagers anything big makes them happy well not so here at judge beans i mean the place was filthy dirty i should have walked out right after i walked in the meat was dry- chicken brisket and pulled pork the server was borderline rude and the service left much to be desired spare your wallet and your stomach and go somewhere else 
excellent healthy delicious fresh top notch service reasonable prices - what else can you ask for i absolutely love seasons 52 i have been there twice and can't wait to go back my husband had the cedar plank salmon which was excellent i had the watermelon tomato salad and the honey roasted 1 2 a chicken which was also excellent highly recommend this place 
this is the worst management company i have ever dealt with they hung up on me twice when i called for service my leasing agent will not call me back they are so rude they will take your money and run stay away 
went to the bercy for happy hour let me start by saying this restaurant is beautiful we sat at the bar there was a nice selection of drinks and food at happy hour prices we had the whitefish cakes which were really delicious we also had the cheese and charcuterie board for dinner we each had a burger which was one of the best i've had the burger was huge too i had to take half of it home which i enjoyed for lunch the next day by the time we left around 7 30 the restaurant was completely full so glad we go there early will definitely be back to try some of the entrees 
this is my go-to spray tan place i've tried multiple places custom and bed and this is by far the most natural looking tan the salon is clean and the girls are great not to mention that they are always on time i will continue to keep coming back 
this place has some of the best sushi i've ever had try the volcano roll - i sub tuna for the conch and its amazing the atmosphere is nothing special and they need to offer a brown rice option for the sushi - but the quality of the fish is outstanding 
walked in and was greeted by the hostess who said sit anywhere you would like but then interrupted by a waiter who said did you have a reservation next time ask where you can be seated which was very rude and unwelcoming as a visitor of santa barbra and a lover of french cuisine i was very disappointed by the service then he awkwardly had a conversation about that with the hostess in front of us which was very unprofessional have some etiquette not a conversation to have in front of a customer my family and i got up and left didn't bother to try their food 
my wife and i were very happy with our stay at le richelieu the location is perfect everything in the french quarter is walkable and great food music and sight-seeing is no more than 15 minutes away on foot we never missed having a car as the various tours we went on picked us up near the hotel the room was very clean and comfortable with a powerful yet silent air conditioning unit the place has great character and great staff the facilities are minimal but you're in nola to see the sights not stay in your hotel a full-service 24-hour restaurant would have been nice for when you're just too exhausted but again who wants hotel food in nola just a block away is the verti marte which has some of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat lots of dining options a little farther than that the wifi was adequate we will stay there again 
this is my first time visiting philadelphia and i thought i would go out for some sushi with co-workers i spoke with the concierge at the marriott and raw was highly recommended big mistake the food was good but the portions of sashimi were small an even bigger issue to us was the horrendous service we ate at the bar the bartender seemed to be going out of her way to be rude and the sashimi that we ordered took 30 minutes to get this is unfortunate as the location and atmosphere are great the bottom line is that if i was to go out for sushi in philadelphia again i would definitely find somewhere else to go 
amazing i am so impressed with this place i have been waiting for tampa to open a place like this for years it blew my mind away i honestly could go on an on about it but nothing would do it jusice take my word for it and jus go save your pennies if you do though nothing is cheap the gift shop books and food take a little hit to your wallet but it's one of those places that is just worth it to me you walk into this cute vintage looking book store with some comfortable seating then you walk down this long hall with high ceilings there in the middle is buddy brew coffee and teabella both are phenomenal establishments on their own between them is some seating for doing work i will say they need wireless there i don't understand why they don't have wireless then there is a gorgeous giftshop with things from around the world after you walk through the gift shop there is a pretty restaurant that serves breakfast brunch and lunch it's the kind of place you want to eat and dine and people watch and stay for forever you can also bring our own bottle of wine and the first one you bring has a free corkage fee just go take my word for it 
tacos soooooooooooo good queso amazing service spectacular highly recommend had brisket crispy beef and catfish tacos catfish were the winner owner and counter person were v personable and interested in our experience love
good authentic vietnamese food service is very attentive it is closed on wednesday my favorite order here is the canh chua ca kho to it is enough to feed a whole family of 4 the ca kho is one of the best i have ever had it rivals even my mom's
paid a visit for burger week nice to have a local beef sorta hip spot in antioch they have 2 for 1 beers til 10 everyday which is kind of misleading cause the beers are smaller than most places ordered wings which were very good and the burger tasted fresh and good the music was a bit loud and pretty average but i'd go back due to the good burger and wings 
wow i think this restaurant's best days are in the past similar to the outdated casinos in vegas the decor was certainly outdated and the food was average at best service was extremely slow especially for a 1pm lunch service when the place was less than half full portions were small dumpling wrappers were hard likely sitting out for a while and certainly overpriced the bento box was 20 and would have been better served as an appetizer they never even brought out my desert which i passed on at the end since my lunch partners were ready to go maybe my expectations were higher but this is my first and last time i'll be dining at buddakan sorry 
the owner and deedee my tech made me feel very welcome and did their best with supplying the details i wanted for my nails the service was excellent and they were so kind 
i've been waiting for an ulta to open up in center city this location was definitely worth the wait its a beautiful bright clean store w three stories high end makeup on 1st floor street level hair products salon on 2nd floor less expensive drug store brands downstairs in the basement their products are great but their customer service here is hit or miss you'll either get super nice helpful or rude unhelpful no middle ground definitely worth a visit but don't be surprised if you have to find everything yourself 
i guess i like this restaurant sort of there is an older man who works here who has a ton of personality and is hilarious he might be filipino despite being listed as a vietnamese restaurant if you come here during the 3 months of the year when the vietnamese owner is back in vietnam you are not likely to get the real deal nor will you be able to order several of the items off the menu in particular the bun bo hue you'll only be allowed to order the items on the menu that whoever is working the restaurant knows how to make and if you're eating in during lunch you might be discouraged from ordering the pho because it takes a while to boil the broth soak the noodles etc despite admonitions the first time i came here i ordered the pho dac biet which took over a half an hour to prepare given that the other three people in my group also ordered pho that the one guy working had to prepare himself it tasted fine if not on the salty side the cuts of beef were much thicker and steak-like than they should have been but the portions were good i also had to ask for sriracha and hoisin sauce and chopsticks so not really what i would go for if i had a legit pho craving but it was edible the second time i ordered one of the vermicelli dishes which tasted fine but didn't have any of the pickled carrots or daikon that are usually included the grilled pork was flavorful though and i finished the entire bowl so the positives cheap staff with lots of personality friendly the not-so-positives - slow - not authentic vietnamese food - can't order several items off the menu unless the right person is in town
my review is only for a knitting shopping experience and does not touch upon their class or other services this place is exactly what it says on the tin - a yarn boutique they carry a few staples - encore cascade andsoforth - and in general seem to have a 'highly curated' selection when i visited today they were hosting a lorna's laces trunkshow overall samples take up as much space if not more as actual stock and everything is neatly tagged they even have a corner for seed beads and grosgrain ribbon the second level has very comfortable looking seating and more needle-point-oriented stock there were two ladies working today and they both greeted me and checked on me after my second slow lap around the store wanted to make sure i wasn't missing anything mary rung me up and gave me a solid recommendation for iced coffee at a bakery a few doors down i left with 2 hanks of sock yarn a lunch destination and a general sense of satisfaction i will probably stop by here again if i'm in the neighborhood again or perhaps for a trunkshow that catches my eye 
hell yeah this place is filled with hot stuff but don't think it's all crazy hot they have different products to try so you can find what suits you they're very knowledgeable about their products tell them what you like ask for suggestions sample them isn't that great you won't waste your money on something you won't enjoy i tried many kinds varieties i loved one hot sauce that had a mustardy kick not too spicy for general purpose use i regularly return for the bee sting thai style hot sauce for asian food my all time fave mr blister garlicky good stuff from louisiana really convenient hours make it easy to stop by when you run out it's also a great place to buy gifts for your foodie friends make up a gift box or get a gift certificate if you're just not sure 
it's a good place to have a drink great bar good beer and friendly bartender but don't eat there the quality of the food is very poor 
great place they fixed my car quickly and with no mechanics nonsense when i went back to clear my car codes they found an additional problem and fixed it for free 
wow above and beyond customer service and friendliness vincent at the front desk is beyond personable and helpful while dr kleinova and the rest of her staff are lovely and super kind i was blown away with the kindness and quality of my visit i'm confident i'll be leaving with a very white smile next week after i have my final teeth-whitening appointment such a pleasant experience and bonus points for text and email confirmations 
very disappointed just ordered my lunch from here the rice is flavorless and the meats are under cooked salad was ok everything was really horrible i lovr persian food and this was disappointing
beet salad was a disappointment as it was more of an arugula salad with barely any beets my pappardelle pasta was a little dry hubby had the lobster ravioli and he liked it service was slow we had s long wait for our dinner won't make it a priority to go back 
the smugglers cove chain has been a long standing love with all of my children thru the years they've never tired of it and my oldest is now 22 my 14 year old son and i were extremely grossed out with this visit however the course is set up within some pretty cool settings including a pirate ship caves and lots of water stinky water like poopy sewage water smelling stench what on earth is going on the smell was so horrid in some of the caves that we skipped a few holes it was absolutely vile we'll be checking out another location next time 
the line was long but moved very very fast we waited in the rain and it was worth it my daughter aged 11 really wanted to come for this one spot she got her fix 
this place looks great however the hours of operation listed on yelp and their nonexistent website are incorrect we had a tight window to grab a good cup of coffee 7 30-8 00am the reviews and listed weekday hours drew us to corner muse when we arrived the times listed on the window said 8 00am we would have double checked the yelp times with their website but the link was not correct either 
i have been a client of craft hair co for over 2 years they always take care of me and do a great job with my long straight hair korie always gives me a great style they do a wonderful job with color also 
can't speak any more highly of this place after already having had fantastic service in the past on the day of a show everything went wrong my guitar neck snapped and my roommates hardware in his pickups started shorting out not only were the folks at dipinto extremely friendly and understanding they also fixed the wiring for the pickups in a matter of minutes and i was able to purchase a replacement guitar on the fly for a mere 75 i already go there for all of my guitar needs now i'm going to tell everyone to do so
i'm from texas so i know good barbecue if you're in the boise area give this place a try their mac n cheese is the best ever if i could only have one kind of mac and cheese forever this would be it it's clean the staff is nice and there are lots of good choices my recommendations for sides would include sweet potato fries too the cole slaw was good but nothing special brisket was perfectly cooked and delicious big fan wish i lived locally so i could go back 
this tour was awesome we had our family of grandparents kids and grandkids so from 6 to 60 the tour held all of our interest and was very entertaining for the kids our guide answered all our questions and told very interesting stories he also phrased things to be appropriate for small ears we all came home and looked up things we had heard about the tour lasted almost 2 hours and we couldn't believe it had been that long at all would highly recommend 
went here to buy perogies the people behind the counter had no idea what i talking about when i asked a simple question when with another customer's help we found the fresh perogies in the display case they looked horrible small and oddly shaped when i asked if they sold frozen ones they pointed to a display case in the case were mrs t's seriously don't bother going here for perogies 
always good so consistent usually have to wait for a table well worth the wai best berger's in town 
this is a true find it has changed my go-to when having mexican food i used to lean towards burritos and quesadillas after having albita's griddled tacos gives them a little crunch it's my new absolute favorite excellent food all-around friendly service small plus getting to be be a recognized regular here try it you'll be happy you did right near the airport entrance 
we go to treasure island on a yearly basis and always add a piece of art in the form of a tattoo this year we tried a new place 13arrows tattoo one of the draws is it is all women artists and they do beautiful work pinky rae started a beautiful tattoo of my fantail koi and she will be adding color soon thank you ladies 
great fresh made burgers crisp fries and friendly staff i got the 3 with egg avocado bacon and cheese wasabi mayo it was juicy and amazing not too hot either the bbq burger is another winner 
so many positives not sure where to begin my wife surprised me with a trip to the city and an eagles game originally from south jersey but haven't been back in many years for christmas she'd never been and i'm big about reading reviews before booking lodging or even eating out so i had no idea what to expect however we will look to stay here again location - excellent located within walking distance to the liberty bell independence hall constitutional hall macy's betsy ross house city hall reading terminal etc there are also plenty of places to eat and shop in the area so don't stress about forgetting anything the only things we wanted to see and needed to uber were the art museum rocky and eagles game decor cleanliness environment - everything was clean and modern you are greeted by a nice fire in the winter and has all these little extra perks that make you feel like you are staying in an expensive place always greeted when you come and go door is held for you awesome recommendations from the staff free booze i can stop there staff - everyone was extremely friendly and answered the million questions i had a special shout out to chloe bre and melissa for making my wife and i's stay extra special visiting philly was an awesome experience and i know that was made in part thanks to this great hotel awesome staff convenient location and affordable price 
this hotel is great it's an old historic building with gorgeous architecture the rooms are very clean and comfortable hotel is in a great location within walking distance of the arch the ball park and many great restaurants 
i recently went to the little cottage looking for squeeker shoes for my 1 year old niece who just learned to walk her 1st birthday party is in two weeks and when i found them at the little cottage i was so excited they had the color and style i wanted but not the size when i asked a passing employee if i could order them in the size i needed and i was more than willing to pay extra for the shipping she acted as if i had inconvenienced her in the worst way we never order special if we do make an order its in bulk and it wouldn't arrive for several weeks you're just going to have to get her a size bigger and have her grow into them she said as she walked away before i could ask any more questions her tone of voice and attitude were very rude even though it is less than a mile from my house and they do have very cute items i will not be shopping here again i'd rather drive farther to a store that is more willing to help their customers in their purchases 
didn't enjoy i won't return sesame chicken is not breaded it's kind of strange and bland most everything was pretty bland i think it's very expensive for the meh taste the portions are big we were really hoping this would be better 
i really enjoy remedy because it's pleasant warm and a truly inviting place in the winter time to meet a friend for tea i'm really obsessed with their rather decadent cream earl grey its so good i also appreciate that their teas and supplies are for sale online the atmosphere is a lot more chill than your normal starbucks with less bustle and more individuals reading chatting or doing work once i went to meet one of my friends and i saw two others we had a cozy reunion 
recently i had my husbands 60th birthday catered by tosco as it is his favorite place to lunch the food was fantastic and the owner and his employees were so helpful they were on time and had everything we agreed upon my guests ate and were very complimentary of the food i facilitate a very large organization and plan events with attendees in excess of 200 people in my business i surely will use this proprietor in the future for business or pleasure thank you to the team 
visited for the second time this past weekend and will try to make this more of a regular stop when visiting the city great selection of beer at prices that can't be beat food was a little weak but can't complain atmosphere was spacious and volume was reasonable greatly exceeded expectations and cannot wait to go back 
the first time i went to urban juicer i did not have the greatest experience the employees were not very friendly and the drink i bought was not good at all i decided to try it again today and got the liver lover and was not a fan at all i love juices and always go to sips in donelson to get juices with the same ingredients but there is just something about the proportion that urban juicer uses that does not make the drinks taste good at all i would not recommend urban juicer since i have had better fresh juices in nashville 
went to martins on a recommendation from a friend and we weren't disappointed we got there just ahead of a big crowd and the service was great we were greeted at the door and the guy explained the menu and how to order two people working the counter were courteous and helpful two of us got ribs and two of us got chicken servings were large and perfectly cooked make sure you specify whether or not you want extra dry rub on the ribs can be a bit overwhelming with all that extra dry rub food showed up at our table in less than five minutes servers checked on us throughout dinner went upstairs to check out the cookers and met the main cook get atmosphere and very kind staff we will be back 
seriously hands down the best sourdough pizza crust i've ever had sour chewy soft yet crispy i got the oyster mushroom pizza with fontina cheese and the flavors were bold and earthy i was definitely full after a whole pizza to myself but literally considered getting another one you know just to try out their other flavor profiles read pizza addict i really hope these guys decide to expand their hours thurs-sun will work for me but i'd like to be here on mondays too 
i'm not picky and the garlic chicken dish i purchased was almost inedible c'mon it's chinese food 
does kenzie play here from castaway show on tv i really like her and want to hear some of her songs 
i am a neighbor to the bercy as i live in downtown ardmore i had the pleasure of visiting for the happy hr one day seated at the bar and was eager to join for dinner my reservation was at 8 45pm on 11 23 and my friends and i party of 3 arrived at 8 45 there was a young woman that greeted us as well as an older woman who seemed to be the manager that didn't pay us much attention we were told that we'd have to wait for our table to get ready even tho we had reservations- shouldn't be much of a wait parties were coming in behind us and being seated immediately 15 mins later we were finally seated once seated no one greeted us not even to welcome us or give us water we waived down the younger hostess and she told us that our server would be right over 10 mins later no one served us so we decided to leave the younger hostess as well as the older manager hostess saw us get up and walk out neither cared to ask us how we were doing in fact the older woman watched us walk out and we overheard her say to the younger one it's okay we took that to mean that she was happy that we left i would really hate to pull the race card here but we were black people the only black guests that were treated as if we weren't welcomed it was very disappointing i don't know that i would return nor recommend others until i hear better experiences for people that look like me and my friends we ended up down the street at the ripplewood and evening tho we didn't have reservations and they were crowded they bent over backwards to get us seated right away 
ok in order of significance kaitlyn and haley were marvelous hostesses very friendly food enthusiasts not afraid to make recommendations which all exceeded our expectations food delicious red fish grill and the grilled tuna were superb i have no idea what the sauce was for the tuna but unfortunately there was not enough sauce for two people yes my wife was sneaking sauce from my plate but in fairness i was sneaking on her plate dessert ok i really wanted to rate this higher but don't want people to think i have no respect for the food pyramid double chocolate bread pudding with ice cream omg atmosphere was energized and trendy probably because all the guests were quite happy nice job and thanks 
this is an awesome indian buffet in the delmar loop the comfortable couches from thai pizza are still there but now the place serves delicious indian food they serve a variety of different curries and naan bread as well as tandoori chicken the food is of excellent quality and the price is pretty reasonable too if you're on the delmar loop this place provides some more variety to the diverse food scene in the area and is certainly worth checking out 
do not use this dental office- they are only there for the money all they want is payments from you and your insurance- running a scam- the place is also not well maintained and doesn't seem clean 
i just got my bike back after some major work at bikers choice it's an older bike i received from a couple friends recently so i wanted the experts to give it a look over before i took over maintenance full-time the staff at bikers choice was awesome never pushy presented all my options and let me make each decision i'll absolutely be back again and again 
had the rooster slinger vegan tasty so much so that 8 wonder if it is truly vegan they have a standard and a vegetarian version of this dish did expect such a large crowd definitely expect a 30 minute wait for sunday brunch i sat at the bar as it was only myself so no wait time also had the samurai bloody mary it was good not earth shattering but better than premixed 
amazing fish spread and crab spread came here for lunch a few weeks ago with my cousin and was pleasantly surprised had fresh stone crab from the market next door that they brought out with their amazing mustard sauce and the salmon spread so delicious and fresh the girls working there are also so sweet and i have been back already to get spreads to bring home 
the little sandwich board sign on germantown finally tempted me down the slate path sadly video games have taught me nothing or i would have found this gem long ago love the breakfast sandwiches love the sliders love the island photos adorning the walls love the garden seating out back 
a starbucks is a starbucks is a starbucks however this one has been remodeled with brand new furniture inside and out wow even a brand new barista 
very good - well priced and best fish tacos on the beach the cabbage is great but make sure you get them blackened also lots of local beer best overall place for the buck when we were visiting 
casual and family friendly cool vibe indoor outdoor seating and bar the service was just ok- pretty slow even though we went during a not busy time otherwise we will be returning and hopefully a little better service next time fish tacos were amazing 
beautiful view of the skyline the food is impeccable and the drinks pair well perfect date night lunch date or brunch 
geeze hyatt wtf dinner buffet was horrible only thing i somewhat enjoyed was the salad bar and seafood gumbo even then the shrimp was overcooked and just mush along with the shrimp and okra pork stew veggie pasta no even desserts tasted cheap i say no just don't go lol
this is my favorite place in prospect park it may come to no surprise to anyone that crab is my favorite food of all time when we moved here amidst the chaos of not knowing where any of our cooking utensils was it was too hot to cook so i walked down the street to this place i met the owner who is just a hard-working and kind person i ordered the crab over fries and it is by far one of the most delicious things i've ever tasted whatever is in that crab sauce is perfect in flavor the portion of the small is so large that i have to cut it in half and take the other half for a second meal at another time it is a rich and delicious sauce but not one that leaves you feeling yucky after if you are anywhere near this place go go go go 
the eddy has been a great addition to reno there are several shipping containers three of which house bars offering a good selection of beer which encircle an inner outside area it reminds me of a small scale version of the container park in downtown las vegas at the eddy you'll find a relaxed fun environment where people enjoy playing bocce ball and other outside games yesterday there was even a dunk tank set up and in use if you are hungry you can nosh on yummy eats available from a couple food trucks if you'd rather not play games there are tv's so you can catch up on your favorite sports and you can even bring well behaved pups like mine 
we have family who lives in edwardsville so visit on occasion annie's is a popular stop before making the 6 hour drive home as i mention in a lot of my reviews i have a tendency to get overwhelmed when too many options are in front me so i almost always defer to the experts at annie's they're happy to make suggestions and the frozen custard is delicious the concretes are the star of the show packed with syrup and candy a little pricey perhaps when compared to fast food ice cream e g dq or mcdonald's but definitely worth popping by if you're in the area 
if you like employees who seemingly don't give a rat's ass about your dining experience and halfway decent ny-style pizza than this is the place for you nothing about this place will woo you but if you live in palm harbor or oldsmar chances are that you will end up here at least once especially if you're a fan of new york pizza they have the market cornered in the area unless you want to drive over to u s 19 and hit up lobosco's i think they've got a decent product but it's missing something and i couldn't put my finger on it maybe some salt in the dough different yeast-to-flour ratio not sure but something was off i've had the pizza here twice and the first time it was room temperature the owner of repeal 18 brought some into the bar one night and i had a slice or two and they tasted great but hot and fresh in the pizzeria was unimpressive for some reason i got a 16 because their 18 pies are for slices only this wasn't a huge deal because i was unable to take down the whole pie anyway i heated up a slice in my toaster over later at night and it was really good better than when it was fresh so the moral of the story here is to avoid eating their pizza when it's fresh because it kind of sucks 
dentnation is pretty awesome i have come in on 3 separate occasions for 3 different dents and they always do fantastic work and are very professional each time they were able to fix the dent while i waited up front in there comfy front lobby i hope i don't get another door ding but if i do i'll definitely be coming back 
this was such a horrible experience for me i'm sensitive to my brows being done well despite the woman's enthusiasm she didn't know what she was doing no matter how many times i explained that i wanted a basic clean up and for them to be left thick because i had been growing them out on purpose she didn't seem to understand she smiled and nodded and then she shaped them into one eyebrow that was decent and the other that was thin like spaghetti string i was so upset i had a conference the next day and was hoping to get a basic clean up but i left there with two totally different eyebrows she offered to make the decent eyebrow thinner to even it out i was horrified and shocked i am not normally sensitive about any other body parts but i get really particular about my brows especially after growing them out for months she let me pay half price and i got in the car and cried and then spend 30 bucks at target for some brow pencil and gel which saved me btw pixie brow gel and pencil was like gold if you are a frequent then that's great but i would not encourage someone to go there for the first time especially those with have unique brow shapes 
this was a fun place to meet for breakfast the food was very good with good sized portions and the service outstanding the only negative was with purchasing our souvenirs but that is a minor issue 
the food here is sooo good i wouldn't order from them via grub hub because they will cancel your order after making you wait an hour but the food is pretty good 
great food great service and great atmosphere had the shrimp fra diavolo and it was delicious my fianc had the chicken marsala and it was amazing 
hostess was rude bartender was great don't know where waitress went expensive don't go here 
great group activity team building or bar hop pregame we were greeted by splinter and offered a beverage from the beer and wine bar limited selection but enough to grease the wheel dogwood was our coach i was pleased with how much direction he offered each of us on our individual mechanics ax throwing form etc plan to tip cash we played three games two team oriented and a last man standing competition dogwood led us through the whole deal it was nice to let someone else corral and lead the group i gave ragnarok 4 stars vs 5 because of the expense some thirty odd bucks per person plus 10 beers can add up quick we were only there for 1hr 30 so this isn't long enough to occupy a full night out i highly recommend ubering up the ale emporium after for wings and pizza 
great building great maintenance however the building needs to redo the pool and other amenities love it either way
i've been going to damaris for 8 months now every 2 weeks she's incredible i'll never go to anyone else my nails are perfect every time and i'm super picky she's so sweet and fun to talk to and always goes above and beyond the salon is beautiful clean and relaxing the drink bar is a welcomed treat love this place 
this was our first visit to new orleans mannings was just a couple blocks from where we stayed we ask at our hotel who served beignets in the area we were told that manning's serve them they were out of this world fantastic they are served with caramel drizzle and pecans while we were in town we tried out another popular location it was a location that is known for serving them they were not near as good as manning's went back tonight and got more
love the island service is always nice and friendly and their beer is so good the honey avocado ale is one of my favorite beers of all time 
i'm a huge fan of poke my first visit here was spot on i got the snow crab poke which was very good and the pricing in my opinion is very appropriate for what you get i can't wait to return and taste the other poke bowls as well as the pho noodles 
service was fairly slow but was understanable as they were very busy and we had 4 people at our table our food was absolutely delicious we wven brought home cheesecake for afterwards we had a double date night with our friend and her boyfriend and it was well worth the time and money a very nice atmosphere with very friendly staff and delicipus food 
farm-to-table concept with a hipster waitstaff and mixologist whipping up your cocktail in a very industrial looking setting and we're here for pasta this chef was put on this earth to make pasta i personally never order pasta while dinning out bc i feel like i can just make something very similar at home not the case a rad i have never eaten a bowl of pasta so slowly yum i'm not sure i would recommend taking just anyone here picky eaters my not have the adventurous ambition to dive into this type of cuisine we tried to step out of our comfort zone and just order off of our waiter's recommendations after a few questions she narrowed down the selections and we went for it no complaints and we enjoyed every bite tip sit outside if it's available great ambiance highlight pasta bucatini fra diavolo octopus rad lardo calabrian chili 18 
good fresh food that is made to order so sometimes it might be a little slow but that's ok i love their coffee good price and excellent service 
i was so excited to try this place and i'm so glad i did 5 stars there were two things that bothered me but not enough to take away a star less than thrilled about 1 the heat we came for lunch and it was slightly busy so there were no tables in the relatively small area that had a fan you can't make outside not hot in new orleans in june but not everywhere was covered and there just wasn't enough shade so it was just so hot i will totally go back but probably at night for dinner 2 i saw this in a comment below about the margaritas it took a minute to get ours because we had no idea to get them from the sliding glass window there wasn't a mention of this or a sign i'll know for next time but since i'm not the first person to say this i hope they invest in a sign or be better about telling the customers everything else we had between us chicken beef and fish tacos chicken and fish were so delicious beef wasn't too bad but i'd get more of the other two next time i really liked the queso and chips the chips are slightly thicker than usually and had a great crunch there are also pomegranate pieces sprinkled in the queso and on the fish taco and they were a good addition the atmosphere was so cute and i genuinely enjoyed being there for the 30 mins or so i was there before it got too hot i had high hopes for barracuda and they didn't disappoint 
what a great night at barcelona from the bartenders to the waiter karl and a very special shout out to gm ennio everything was perfect service food and hospitality were excellent the only downside is gm ennio di nino is only there temporarily need to keep him in philly highly recommend 
i've come here twice and enjoyed the food both times i've tried the eggplant parmesan and the chicken picatta and both were delicious especially the picatta service is also great 
this hotel is in big trouble once other hotels start opening nearby the service is not the best simple fixes are always an issue our bathroom had mold in it it took asking 4 people and 30 minutes just to get a wine bottle opener to be sent to the room as i lay in bed ready for sleep at 10 30pm the fire alarm went off and sent everyone out of the hotel but only our floor for some reason the hotel itself after taking a closer look needs a lot more help aside from its location and proximity to downtown this hotel is not my favorite 
i have lived at these apartments for 1 year i usually move every year because i don't really like the place but verde apartments is a great place to live at i have never had any major issues the staff is great they have always helped me out when i needed it the maintenance staff is also great they always greet me in the morning while i leave to school work they are very nice people these apartments has a gym two laundry rooms that are always maintained and cleaned two nice pools i really cool club house area opened during office hours im a student living on my own and i love how the other tenants make me feel at home they are always really nice this place is at a convenient location specially if you're a student there's a gym across the way and grocery stores and restaurants all walking distance i forgot to add how easy it is to pay your rent all you have to do is log in online and pay it from home 
well i got two new tires - 2 weeks later the low tire pressure light came on took it in - no leak found two weeks after that same thing low tire pressure light same new tire this time the automotive manager tells me they are busy bring it in monday we are not busy then busy charging someone else for work to be done - are busy 1 2 doing another job which busy then customer services tells me they can't get anybody to answer the phone i am just real sorry that i even expected walmart - to do a good job at anything can i suggest customer service training for your staff and or just closing your damn doors until u can find better mechanics 
best tacos i've ever had taco tuesday's deal was worth the wait my girl and i had a ball cool atmosphere and great staff service if you go on tuesday be prepared for a crowd and a wait of at least 20mins 
best place in the history of the world quick car wash in and out have to do the unlimited plan never more than a few minutes wait only downside is they don't sell the dolls that sit in the dryer room sesame street or a doll that looks like a scrubber 
this is excellent indian food i asked the waiter 2 times what he recommends that is dairy free and he has never steered me wrong i said i like spicy food and so i tried a 3 out of 5 and wow it was pretty spicy the next time i got a 2 and it was perfect the flavors are amazing and the atmosphere is clean and neat they have a bar area and serve all kinds of cocktails and wine loved it 
i just love this practice everyone there is kind and helpful i have seen dr scannon and the 3 pas and they are all wonderful knowledgeable and very caring sandy snyder is probably my favorite but i recommend them all best derms around 
flame is what it is for the yelpers not knowing what flame is flame is the other word for good great awesome fantastic food was really good made fast and i mean price was okay i did a take out order so i cant comment much on the place but the food was good i got fried rice and sesame chicken flame 
man oh man this place is gonna be my new go to spot to take my special woman i ordered takeout from here the other night wow it was incredible the real deal here you could tell they only use the finest and best quality ingredients apparently it is also a wine bar as well i'm super excited to try their other foods and see what my better half thinks of it this place almost has a near perfect review so you don't have to take my word from it check out all the others p enjoy 
i tired liking this place we came in at 8pm wife daughter on a monday night for some dessert but everything i ate was way too sweet the glaze was too thick and the selection was just all donuts with cereal on top maybe i'll try going in the morning and seeing if they have a better selection the place was very clean and the employee were attentive it had plenty of room for big groups and also had a kid children's play wall with chalk and letter which is a plus for my toddler to keep her busy so i can try the donuts 
no one likes getting their car smog'd but these guys were true to their word and had us in and out of there in less than an hour on what appeared to be a really busy saturday afternoon greatly appreciated their service 
beautiful venue and wonderful food i have eaten here for breakfast and lunch and am always blown away by the quality of the cuisine the attention to detail is evident in each dish and every drink i often bring out of town friends here to enjoy the atmosphere such a gorgeous interior and unique concept with the restaurant bookstore and boutique i have enjoyed oe for weddings just a magical location all the way around 
unethical unprofessional and very bad office employees unethical slow and useless office employees i got my insurance last year around september i made an appt to go do a physical exam and make sure everything was fine got my appt for december 19 place is clean even though i had an appt they made me wait almost an hr for doctor to see me they did some lab work to go my general check up that also too took long in january 31 2018 i get a invoice from sonora quest billing me for some lab work i called carondelet office and told them this was preventative exams and that it shouldn't be billed if it was preventive care exams they said it may had been coded wrong and that they will look into it and let me know weeks passed by and no answer from corondelet i kept communicating with sonora quest and told them carondelet was looking into a possible coding error long story short they sat on my paperwork for months i got sent to collections because of them never resolving anything when i stopped at their office twice they told me that the person who was looking into it was no longer working there so basically my paperwork just sat on a desk and nobody did anything about it they told me its all coded correctly just pay it and basically washed their hands of the fact that they sat on my paperwork for months and because of them i get sent to collections i took care of the payment but wanted to leave a review here what they did was unprofessional unethical and instead of helping me they screwed me over 
one of the best places on the east side for breakfast try the chorizo skillet to die for 
food was great had fish shrimp taco and cali burrito and order of corn if nothing else try the corn 
noooooooooooo such bad service waited an hour to get lumber cut kept trying to get them paged they paged four times and no one came so i called the front twice and then finallllly was told that the lumber associates were on lunch all of them when they finally came they messed up all my cuts i get that you don't do precision cutting definitely should not have asked i avoid this place like the plague if i can if you do go don't expect anything but terrible service better research beforehand 
this place has great coffee and food for all times of the day the place is decked out with with everything music and very clean and new been going 3 weeks straight with hint of disappointment 
stopped here for a meeting and decided to try their black cold brew surprisingly the cold brew was better than my expectations it was not bitter at all and it was pretty smooth the cold brew itself was a 4 5 i would say my friend who was also ordering wanted an iced coffee with almond milk but they didn't have iced coffee that day and they don't serve almond milk they have a lot of seating however some of the chairs are ripped but there is a good amount of seating at this location 
this is my go to place in metairie la the food and drinks are yummy yummy ask for the anna al special woodford reserve glenlivet 
love this place the vegan asian wrap is my fav also had the vegan buffalo wrap as well both are great the asian salad with asian dressing has a wonderful flavor and the veggies are always so fresh and tasty it is so nice to have vegan options not found very often and it is so delicious 
we had breakfast here yesterday and it was wonderful the waitress was most accommodating breakfast didn't start until 10 but we were welcomed in at 9 30 the food was really good i got the breakfast special husband got a breakfast platter as well the topper was that the beignets were to die for we got them to go and brought them back to the time share they truly were amazing don't miss them we also had dinner a few night ago the pot roast and horseradish mashed potatoes was delicious i had the sliders which was good too don't forget to get the beignets 
place is filthy and not very welcoming will not be returning here for sure take your talents somewhere across the street but deff skip this joint
amazing selection amazing pastries a little pricey and a bit of a wait but well worth it great quality food and desserts 
from beginning to end everything was superb natalie was able to get me in on a busy saturday and brooke made a birthday girls dream come true with my perfect little tattoo if you are looking for a professional efficient place to get a tattoo look no further 
blackened salmon w lemon chardonnay butter a definite must have when you visit the salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce you want to sop up with a biscuit figuratively anywho don't miss out on this dish i also had the pleasure of trying some of the santa fe spring rolls and spinach artichoke dip they were not a disappointment looking forward to my next visit 
pretty good burger much better than five guys and it is natural a little pricey but it is well worth it it has a nice touch where you can finish your burger with a beer score 
great guacamole excellent quality ingredients and good service busy place occasional 10-20 minute wait for a table--good drinks at the bar 
i came in today during a brief visit to nola have been having some acute on chronic right shoulder pain and desperately needed some body work had a magical deep tissue massage by brittany she helped my pain so much and she was extremely knowledgable and i am an osteopathic physician saying that i would definitely recommend her the customer service was also great the space is beautiful about 5 minutes into my massage someone started hammering apparently people had just moved in upstairs the therapist politely excused herself the hammering stopped and she started over my time from that point on very nice i got an extra five minutes 
this is probably our new favorite place to hike we did the limestone hill trail it was only about 1 5 miles and only had a short bit of up-hill - it was definitely a nice easy hike there aren't any look outs or any special views but the walk is so simple and pleasant that it doesn't matter there's also a playground and a shorter paved loop 
they are always so friendly and i love the skinny fries the burgers are good also the custard o m g y u m m y 
i had always been wanting to come to this place for dinner for along time before they were closed due to making changes i finally go to eat here tonight and the food is great i can't wait to go to their lunch time 
heard a lot of mixed reviews about this place from friends who live nearby and finally went last saturday the space is beautiful dim lighting and neat interior touches the patio seemed like the best spot but as we didn't have a reservation we could only sit inside it was like eight on a saturday so we couldn't really complain we were sat right next to the only other table in the dining area also not a big deal but kind of awkward we start with cocktails - mine was a take on a french 75 with bourbon good but not much bourbon flavor my friend's aviation was better the cocktails are well priced we started with a cheese tray - solid i got the burger others at the table ordered veggies and polenta and the american wings the burger decent i was disappointed that the pickled shallots and aioli didn't have more flavor nothing really stood out about it but it was perfectly cooked the dipping sauce for the frites was dank wings well my friend hated them i thought they were alright very spicy which the menu didn't indicate and she couldn't deal with it i love spice so i didn't find it overwhelming but the flavor was still off somehow veggies and polenta polenta was a bit salty the mushrooms were beautiful but overall the dish just fell flat the description said it was served with a citrus sauce but it didn't stand out maybe they're still ironing out the kinks in the kitchen i hope so because i love the space 
wow what a treat great and creative breakfast in a homey neighborhood and with live music to boot kid friendly and yummy friendly locals in line with us asked us tourists to join them at their table small place so tables were in short supply by the way ck it out if you are in algiers us not algeria that is 
super fun i would definitely come back any day only problem was i paid 3 for the alligator food and only got 4 pellets i wish they would give out more atmosphere was very clean and very relaxing they need to clean out the water though 
magnifico met the executive chef who spoke with a heavy italian accent at a nearby coffee shop earlier in the day who invited me to eat here so i decided to give it a try made a reservation for my husband and me which was made easy through my phone we were greeted with a beautiful soprano voice singing opera and a warm welcome the waiter freely gave us time to look over the menu while we sipped on a delicious glass of italian wine we ordered an appetizer of calamari and polenta and received an endless basket of crusty bread and dipping oil i had the frutti de mare with fettuccine and my husband had the pork tenderloin with a spicy mango sauce all of the pasta is homemade as well as the sauces yum we finished the evening with dessert of tiramisu which was also homemade and took home a cannoli both were light as a cloud and not too sweet the executive chef came out to greet us not once but twice the owner and hostess were personable and invited us to come again the soprano came to our table to talk with us too if you want delicious food a romantic setting and lots of attentiveness you will love this hidden treasure forget those chain faux italian restaurants this is the real deal we'll be returning again and again 
when i eat at a restaurant i expect the food quality to be better than i can make at home my wife and i shared a fried pickle appetizer decent after you press all the grease out and a pulled pork plate with macaroni and cheese cheese grits and an added side of greens i'd rather eat bad organic box mac and cheese compared to the pasty thick thing they brought me i am assuming the pulled pork was pulled out of a freezer because it wasn't hot warm and was very dry don't waste your time or money at this restaurant 
there's no question that castleton square is my go to mall in indy though i suppose that's not really saying much these days considering the only other really decent options are fashion mall and greenwood park i mean seriously have you been to washington square lately i live in one of the most challenging neighborhoods in indy and even i'm looking over my shoulder there lafayette square well um yeah seriously though for me greenwood park is generally too far i do actually go to the fashion mall especially if i plan to eat dinner while shopping but for most of my shopping needs i still find myself at castleton square castleton square is still a simon mall being that simon is an indiana-based company you'd expect that to me it would be a well cared for establishment nah it's not the only one that simon seems to care about here is fashion mall castleton square is maintained but seldom truly updated it also doesn't get near the publicity as evidenced by several recent quick retail failures within mall grounds including gobsmacked a restaurant that took over houlihan's but died quicker than the u s in world cup soccer as most know the sears closing knocked out a huge anchor at castleton square there's rumors that there's going to be some major renovation in their spot desperately needed but we'll have to wait and see since no announcement has been made castleton square is an indoor mall though it has multiple entrances and all of the anchor stores that remain jc penney von maur macy's also have multiple entrances amc castleton square which recently a rather major renovation that included an imax theatre is really the only area of the mall that seems to have gotten recent attention the food court which was a renovation project from a few years back is still bright and populated but with two recent departures even it seems to struggle a bit with chick-fil-a being by far the most popular option along with luca pizza indy burger and a couple asian cuisine joints along with freshway there's a poke' place scheduled to open soon along with one other restaurant on weekends you can still find a train that transports kids along the mall route for a fee the center of the mall is also still known to host events and currently right now has a pretty cool virtual reality vendor i have been noticing as of late that as vendors move out there's some vendors getting nice updates macy's for example has been renovating like crazy and is actually quite nice i'd like to see this mall go the way of greenwood park - weaving together some open air options with some traditional options maybe a combo of glendale town center and greenwood this mall gets a bad rap due to some occasional behavioral issues that surface from time-to-time though police do have a substation in the mall and i've never felt unsafe here unlike washington square - which is a poorly maintained pit that needs to be demolished i'd like to see this mall get a more practical retailer - like say a target which ironically is the only reason to go to washington square while places like fye and thinkgeek are a blast they're not really reasons to go to a mall blondie's cookies opened up a really nice spot here but again places like spencer's and yankee candle or even the myriad of clothing options are terrific but not destination retailers people need a reason to go to the mall and castleton square simply doesn't have too many destination retailers this is still a preferred spot for me i love fashion mall which undoubtedly has better food options but for more ordinary shopping needs this is my spot with some renovation and upgrading along with a re-design at the sears end castleton square could easily survive this current downward trend for malls and situate itself for years to come in terms of access castleton square still has accessible parking at virtually all entrances though it's worth noting that not every entrance has power doors the main entrances are pretty decent about it but if you're needing such an option you might drive by the entryway first most of the retails are pretty accessible some more crowded than others though the main accessible restrooms are near the food court including a family bathroom 
the food was good but not great i went during dinner and for the price i paid i was little disappointed however based on what other yelpers have described i have a feeling the lunch and dinner portions are similar had i paid lunch prices i would have been much happier with what i got chicken pad thai dry and the chicken was tough shimp dumpling soup broth wasn't that flavorful the dumplings were decent though i would definitely go back for lunch but would skip for dinner 
i went here for lunch with a friend today her choice and judging by the look of the place was expecting something fairly mediocre the cashier waiting to take our order was very sweet and the food came out quickly the fried rice was ok nothing to write home about and the beef with broccoli was ok the price for the combination plate was 6 60 which i found reasonable for what you get overall i expected mediocre and that's pretty much what i got my friend ordered the hot braised chicken and loved it so maybe i ordered the wrong thing also parking is weird we had to park in the jack in the box lot i'll try it again but this wasn't my favorite chinese place 
it isn't that the recipes aren't good or the ingredients aren't good but the execution on the food is subpar i guess it is mostly a cool bar that serves food the scene is hopping i live around the corner and i think today is the last time i'll eat here if they would execute at a high level the food would be really good 
the food was good a bit pricey i had the 2 person steak and lobster special with my family did get a lot of steak and lobster this is a nice place to go to if you are staying near the airport 
wonderful food great service in a super relaxing clean environment our party if three ordered different breakfast dishes and all complimented how great the food was 
it's a mcdonald's so my expectations are low going in but this location must go out of their way to look for incompetence no one in drive through when i arrive i sit and wait 6 min before they take my order meanwhile in the other lane a cars pulls in and orders while i'm sitting there then they screw up my drinks my kid wanted a happy meal otherwise i would have took off next time i will drive further to avoid this particular mcdonald's 
the customer service was great while i the store but when checking out the store clerk put the batteries in for the vibrator i was about to buy and initially had trouble with it and stated the batteries might be going out but then vibrator appeared to work however when i got home to use it it lasted like 1 minuet and i thought it was the batteries so i bought new ones and put them in but the vibration was barely even working so i am convinced the worker accidentally broke a piece when putting the vibrator together at the store i called in and told the person working and they just gave me the manufacturer information and it is not even worth the trouble trying to go through them to get a new one so i will definitely never buy any toys from this place again since there is no refunds which is understandable for the most part but they weren't very understanding in my case 
absolutely the best thai noodles in philly and for a great price the owners are very nice service is speedy i've never waited more than 5-10 minutes even during lunch hour -- much faster than most chinese places and as a bonus they have a really fun selection of thai beverages while there is a counter to dine-in if you're in a hurry this is as the name suggests a location to order your food to go the counter faces the street and is great for people watching 
the service was great staff was very nice but the place is filthy napkins all over the floor throughout the place the counter where u doctor up your coffee is just horrible spilt coffee trash is full running out the top empty sugar packs every where and dirty tables no excuse bc there is maybe 15 people here love this place but so disappointed with the cleanliness
got some pies for supper upon arrival from montreal i've been trying britt's pies for four years now pleased to say that the pizza is still very good if you're a fan of thin crust coal oven pizzas you will not be disappointed with britt's 
great coffee shop nestled away on the dudley street side of bok bar next to south philly sm khaus hard to find but totally worth searching for does not have a sign on the outside located in the converted bok technical school and named two persons paying homage to edward bok's novel open seven days a week carries passenger coffee from lancaster pa which was named food wine magazine best coffee in pennsylvania in 2018 the owners are very friendly and you can make an entire day out of all there is to do in the thriving building that was once an abandoned school 
this place has been a godsend to me we have been putting in a new kitchen for the past 2 months and have eaten most of our meals from hidden grill every meal has been delicious with a wide variety of choices the people who run it are friendly the food is ready on time and is reasonably price i recommend this place to anyone who needs a healthy delicious meal 
this was my first visit i had the coconut curry salmon it was excellent but the sides were sparse - one piece of broccoli and 2 baby carrot pieces mostly for color we had the apple pie with cinnamon ice cream and it was great service was good and people were friendly 
i came for an advertised free 2 year anniversary event the event was listed as free hors d'oeuvres and a live dj from 7-10 we arrived about 7 15 and promptly greeted i showed the ticket i had to register for to get in free i was immediately asked by the lady at the door 'were you prepped' for how this is going' uh no 'well i was made to be the bad guy and have to tell you it's s 5 cover to get in but you get free hors d'oeuvres' what the bait and switch it cost 5 to get in the free event crap is this i paid for parking and used gas please read my first review of this establishment they offer poor service with mediocre food and fake free events i would not suggest you dine here ever fake free or real free it's not a fine palate it's a fine mess 
unique in the edmonton food scene quick and reasonably priced great quality of food and friendly staff 
newly renovated the cedars house is located at the beginning of forbidden drive in fairmount park this unique fitness spot offers a hub for runners walkers and bikers they have a menu of light healthy fare including breakfast items sandwiches and smoothies they have lockers that you can rent if you want to stash personal belongings during your run walk or hike they also feature programming that includes mat pilates yoga meditation massage personal training and kids activities there is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating where you can enjoy your post-workout snack they've also got restrooms which are always nice if you've been on the trails a while it's great to have another spot other than the valley green inn along the trails especially one that is so committed to the community of fitness enthusiasts and amateurs alike that frequent the park i thoroughly enjoyed my mango strawberry smoothie after my workout this afternoon my only suggestion go easy on the added grape juice next time 
delicious but be prepared to wait for goodness if in a rush i recommend calling ahead for pick up also notable if you're ordering a stuffed or specialty item and want a standard pretzel or twist to request a fresh made our table of seven all received a fresh baked product except my daughter the biggest pretzel lover of all who had a pre-baked case item to our surprise and disappointment overall our meal was very good pretzels delicious so a return visit is in our future with a few tweaks to our ordering process 
came in on a friday around 6pm- not crowded at all sat at a table- never acknowledged until we spoke up was over 10 minutes michael our server walked by us many times with no acknowledgement after speaking with a manager - who tried to make up for it- we were comped drinks 2 appetizers- very bad experience won't be back many many other places around here to choose from- do it 
we decided to take a chance and try a new restaurant for lunch and we were so glad we did our server tristan was very attentive and genuine the food was delicious i had the harvest salad which was wonderful i substituted balsamic instead of blue cheese dressing there were so many tasty ingredients in the salad including grilled chicken which tasted freshly grilled my husband got a cheeseburger which he thoroughly enjoyed i can't say enough about the service tristan really made lunch a pleasure we will definitely return 
i had been to this location several times and have been very happy i'm going to try to make this story short but i'm not sure that i can i went in for sinus infection symptoms and my heart rate was fast so they took a blood sample which they did terribly i might add i am diabetic and have had blood drawn several times and it doesn't usually hurt or bruise this time i bled heavily and have a huge bruise a sure sign that the tech is inexperienced my blood sugar came back high i could have told them that i'm sick it's going to happen somehow this all comes down to them telling me to get a ct scan i told them that i was concerned that my insurance wouldn't cover this service they tell me that i can do it now or in the hospital feeling bullied i just get it ct comes back with nothing on it sooo i'm going to pay 5 000 to be told i'm diabetic thanks guys not like i already knew that no treatment for the sinus infection whatsoever saw my primary care doctor and got much needed antibiotics never once saw an actual doctor which i thought was a major benefit of going to urgent care 
save your money don't buy anything from here instead go to ashley furniture or even a local thrift store for better quality i bought a 1000 00 set which ruined our front doorway during delivery and broke 2 months later luckily manufacturer warranty covered the replacement and it was delivered this morning this time the guy covered the doorway to prevent further damage but they then ruined the blinds that cover my front door they weren't even aware that they were replacing my couches and would have to haul off our old set upon inspection the bottom part of the couch is chipped at this point i'm just going to pay off the couches and say good riddance again save your money and go elsewhere 
this place is a hidden gem the service is excellent the barbacoa is a great choice and so are all the tacos great place to go for authentic mexican food and great prices can't wait to go back 
what a charming experience my husband and i ate here for our anniversary love the small booths and delicious food we over-ordered and sampled a bit of almost everything and it was all great the drinks were wonderful too 
i have been coming to this waffle house for a long time i have never been disappointed coming here the food is always good the staff is always friendly and they are always quick it has a consistency that is hard to find at other restaurants excluding fast food and while some waffle houses feel a little bit sketchy i have never felt that away about this one it's always clean and reliable although i have never come at midnight either pretty much everything on the menu is good with the standout being the hash browns which are fantastic it's typical fare for a waffle house i think all of their menu's are the same the only minor complaint i have is they aren't as cheap as they used to be but they are still reasonably priced some items seem to be more affordable than others hash browns are insanely cheap omelettes are a little bit high but nothing is going to break the budget if your looking for fast reliable reasonably priced breakfast place this place will never let you down 
great place for football game day over 12 large tvs and cheap drink specials food was fast hot and really well priced i got 3 specialty drafts and a sandwich with fries for 17 
the short version the food is pretty good the service tends to be on the slow side and the prices are just a little on the high side it's fine but not amazing the slightly longer version after three trips to datz st pete i've concluded it's a place i'm happy to go if suggested by a friend but i probably won't ever be the friend suggesting it the food is good as long as you're expecting big bar food - it's burgers and chips and fried and greasy and gooey the portions are huge but unfortunately greasy messy enough that the leftovers were a bit of a flop literally in the case of the chips others might not mind a lack of good leftovers but i'm always a bit bummed when i can't eat half the meal it's also a bit pricey on one visit i ordered the high steaks bowl - steak and brussels sprouts over cheesy grits - for 18 the steak was cooked well but tiny ditto the sprouts the grits were fine bu it was basically a big bowl of cheesy grits with a little bit of the good stuff for a lower price tag i wouldn't have minded but 18 for essentially a bowl of grits was bit disappointing the servers are all pretty nice but all seem to have larger sections than they can handle or perhaps the kitchen is slammed - service has never been egregiously slow but it's also definitely never been fast i wouldn't come here if you have a short window of time anyway it's not like i'll never go back - i just probably won't be the one to suggest it 
meh nice ambiance was happy with the table ordered a cucumber gimlet drink came in a smoker that permitted the area once opened this is an odd choice for presentation kind of ruins a refreshing drink by giving it such a strong smokehouse scent had escargot as appetizer very bland was just sitting in oil and garlic needed seasoning would not order again sea bass was good but not great wagyu steak was fantastic and saved the day side item baked lobster mac and cheese looked great but came cold to the touch in the center some lobster sprinkled on the top but but nothing more than a typical baked mac dessert was good for the price there are better options in tampa 
i came with my family only 2 of the 5 of us ordered because most of the ice cream was so freezer burned the rest of us decided to go without the store wasn't particularly clean and the server wasn't friendly or helpful she was an order taker at best didn't offer any samples while we were perusing the many choices and never smiled 12 for 2 singles scoops of ice cream 1 with a topping i would expect both better quality and better service 
the quality has gone down a lot lot from about 2 years ago used to frequent this place but have had terrible rice plates the past few times switching over to the masala place instead of here 
they have the best greek salad in the area no anchovies available but for some reason their feta is the best adjacent parking very helpful i like the pizza but you can launch hours of debate if you ask someone in havertown about pizza everyone has an opinion but i like hoopty's a lot 
i had not been here in years and today i was not disappointed the reuben was very tasty the place is small but extremely clean the people are super friendly and the service is quick i will be back thank you 
like the food thursday special prime rib sandwich is delicious love to play trivia here on thursday nights as well
i used a regal limousine service to take a few friends around for our 25th high school reunion a regal had the best price i could find our driver ray was on time very courteous and professional couldn't have asked for a better night for the price 
i'm not a donut guy - but these were awesome the dough itself is so soft light and spongy perfect texture lots of crazy flavors too better than dunkin for sure if you are in the market - definitely give this place a try 
first a disclaimer i'm not really into paintball so i'm not up on the fine points of what constitutes a great paintball facility poco loco is located near limerick pa it has maybe 9-10 different settings that they use for play many are hilly and or rocky and most are dotted with rudimentary huts and walls some of the areas seemed cramped others quite large the staging area is small and it seemed to me a novice a bit disorganized the folks playing there ranged from ultra-enthusiast to novice sometimes grouped together sometimes grouped by skill level in all it's nearby to philadelphia and the burbs and a fun way to spend a fall afternoon 
beware a few co-workers ordered sausages from this food truck and they were not completely cooked the inside was red this is unacceptable also one of the guys on the truck was very rude i politely asked if i could see the size of their sausages as i wanted to know what i was getting for 9 he rudely told me to check our their website and turned his back towards me as if the conversation was over the customer service alone is why i decided not to try this place and now that i know they sell uncooked food i will never try them 
the food is great would recommend coming early because the wait may be long on the weekends 
no this was an expensive disappointment for 70 worth of take out for a family a four none of us were happy i will offset this review with a very positive review of another asian place in town that exceeded our expectations re asian - no flavor whatsoever re sushi - overpriced small rolls totaling 20 everything was edible but so lacking my husband and i dumped sricachi on it all to give it any flavor don't think they will last
such an odd concept of asian grocery and restaurant but the oddity makes it interesting it's a self seating place where the store checkout line is also the food order line order first and they will call out your number it is a very simple place with good food definitely a gem in all the nonexistent diversity that is indiana 
i stopped in for coffee right after getting off the plane the coffee is delicious i sat outside on the back patio there is a dog water station so bring your pets the inside of the shop is a bit small they were also playing good music stop in for the coffee and good vibes 
excellent excellent excellent that pretty much sums them up great steak unbelievable potato and a ranch dressing that is out of this world friendly people great dining experience and they have a pork chop to die for
after moving into the neighborhood a few days ago i was disappointed to find the state of food options north of the 3900 block of lancaster to be lacking following my experience of buying chinese food through a bullet proof window last night i was determined to find something better in this neighborhood a coffee shop with food would be perfect while i studied and then this afternoon i stumbled upon reed's coffee and tea house the extremely kind woman behind the counter recommended the homemade tuna sandwich and i added a chai tea to complement the meal as a small favor i asked if the tuna could be blended with a little bit of mustard not a problem first off the tuna sandwich - and this is not hyperbole - was the best tuna sandwich i have ever had and that was not the mustard talking had i not been enjoying it so much i might've actually looked inside to understand what made up the flavors but i had scooped up the leftovers from the plate before thinking of the idea second you couldn't find a nicer person working at a coffee shop third i don't drink coffee but its advertised as organic and there is a nice variety of teas starbucks doesn't need your money places like this mom and pop shop do 
we checked out the listening room cafe during our trip in november hopefully the google listing has been updated since then we ended up ubering to the old location without realizing they had moved we ended up taking another uber to the new location the venue was super cute they were quick in seating you despite the long line we enjoyed the songwriter's performances with their back stories to each song i would definitely go again if i'm ever in the area again 
was excited to try this place very friendly staff who walked us through all the options great presentation and even better tasting bowl will definitely be back 
i rarely write a negative reviews and like to focus on the positive however we were disappointed with our experience at puckett's we had 730 reservations on a sunday night and waited around 20 minutes for a table no big deal once seated we waited another 15 minutes for a waitress to stop by and acknowledge us she said she'd be right back but after waiting another 15 minutes we decided to find another restaurant my point - even with a reservation and a table you may wait so keep that in mind we went over to nash house and were seated and served right away had great southern food fried green tomatoes deviled eggs and hot chicken and heard two aspiring young singer song writers 
i ordered from here and wow the flavor was amazing i got the whiting platter with potatoes and green beans with the yellow rice this has to be some of the best soul food i've had in philly 
buffet tasted below average the gravies had overcooked chunks of chicken which were rubbery chicken wings in the buffet was a surprise and the best dish by far the gravies and tandoori chicken had tons of food color not a place i'd want to visit again 
very broad menu food was very good and great service 
great hot pot for the late night dinner but take care the dish sizes are a little bit small order more lol
i am a out of towner from south carolina great service on labor day with only 1 hour to closing what a great staff unable to fix my problem due not having the part in stock advised me of the part needed tried every way possible to remedy the issue come to century buick gmc and be met by a knowledgeable friendly staff like you were family thanks everyone 
part of reno's largest hotel casino complex that is located downtown it has its own easy to use parking structure sometimes you drive right in other times you need a ticket at the gate tickets can be validated for free parking inside the casino almost anywhere besides a huge first floor of casino games the eldorado is home to several great restaurants and bars check out individual reviews for lastrada roxy's the buffet brew brother's millie's 24 and pho mein roxy's has one of the best happy hours in town they also have a fantastic theater that hosts great shows year round comfortable seats with great views affordable priced tickets that can be combined with yummy meals at a discount a fantastic spot to camp out a few times a year to the various crawls reno is host to seats in roxy's at the top of the escalator have been my favorite warm spot to watch the santa crawl from the hotel has been around for awhile the rooms are nice and comfortable but could use a little updating 
drinks were ok and location is good but the food more than 20 per dish was just defrosted and served it took just 5 minutes to serve two steaks and potatoes were hot outside and very cold inside btw steaks tasted like they long passed their due date 
i took a group of students here while in town for an event the line was forever long and they were groaning by the time we left they were all smiles taking about wanting to come again the staff handled the high amount of traffic beautifully there was something for everyone turnover on tables was fantastic so we had a place to sit i personally had a white slice and am eggplant parmesan slice fantastic taste nice thin foldable crust perfect they live up to the 'ny style' 
the only way that the original naked chocolate could have been improved was by making it more convenient to those of us west of the schuylkill and lo and behold they went and did it i stopped in for breakfast the other day with a friend and not only was the hot chocolate the cinnamon twist and our muffin delicious but our server was just about tickled pink to be serving us yay for the amazing treats and the overenthusiastic staff 
inventive beautiful interactive cocktails lots of work and thought goes into the menu beautiful vintage secret garden space nice bartenders too 
once again love and thanks to fellow yelpers for turning me onto a new place i might not have found otherwise it's been on my list for weeks and i just got in today as soon as i walked in i was greeted enthusiastically by both the hostess and a server resulting in good vibes from the get go within a minute or two max of being seated my server was bringing water and offering two different kinds of coffee i ordered today's special coffee toffee-infused higher octane caf-plus not surprisingly the rest of my day has proved super productive i know i'm weird but i love that they list the calorie content on the menu under each entree i enjoy being an informed consumer and it actually helps me with my food guilt case in point i was squeamish about ordering the crab cake benedict but at only 900 cal compared to say the protein breakfast at 1130 cal given the bacon or sausage for which i would have opted i was more than willing to take on the extra carb load to get the crabby goodness and i already know what i want to order next time i'm here the spicy honey chicken biscuit at 360 cal for 3 99 that'sa no brainer i'd get it today for dessert but know i won't have room pictures on yelp show huge portions sure enough my benedict was all i could handle got it with the home fries i could have opted for hash browns or grits as other possibilities the home fries 1 2 in potato chunks seemed very evenly fried perhaps even deep-fried and tasty but without much if any seasoning which i would have liked now i'm not a big proponent of salt mind you barely even cooking with it myself but while the benedicts themselves were very good with a rich and creamy hollandaise those too were a little under-seasoned in every way cakes under-spiced no perceptible salt and pepper on the poached eggs and the hollandaise was only very subtlety lemony tangy my brunch companion had the veggie omelette with choice of bread she opted for rye toast not the hog-jaw like me she ended up taking some of it home we probably over-stayed having lots to discuss our server tracy was great and never rushed us out leaving once again we got an enthusiastic goodbye from more than one server while food quality was very good the service and their portions are even better they made me want to come back 
not sure if they did it on purpose or not it is almost insanity to pay my bill every month via their website i had to download google chrome to make payments per their request and i still have to pay the bill over the phone how in the world does a financial institution screw up payment options this badly i don't send my payments via snail mail i haven't since the early 2000's this is the year 2018 it shouldn't be this hard to make my payment stop redirecting me to places that wont work on a mac or are incapable of working period 
i've always passed by the discovery center but about two weekends ago my room mate and i decided to check it out for ourselves we at first originally thought this place was for kids and it is but we realized it's just as much for adults too we took out time while walking through the different areas observing and learning with the many interactive exhibits after paying admission you are welcomed to a vast sculpture where kids can climb from the bottom floor to the top below is home to other exhibits which i'll explain later we first walked through the exhibit that informed us more about nevada about it's history native animals etc i personally don't consider myself a true local since i came here less than a decade ago and taking the time to further and better understand nevada was truly an enriching experience we then walked through on of my favorite sections i felt like i was back in high school in a science lab or better yet one of those bill nye the science guy episodes there was a lot of cool and fun interactive activities that we participated in for example there was a vein viewer a machine that uses infrared to easily see your veins under your skin another example would be a heart rate monitor that shows your heart beat on a giant screen for all to see there was also a color blind test to which we discovered my room mate was partially color blind or she just has really bad vision other exhibits conveyed physics robotics puzzles and much more this review would be a novel if i were to explain everything the discovery center had to offer my best advice is to take a day to bring friends and or family to enjoy the discovery center yourselves it was such an enlightening experience 
this is an excellent find in downtown st pete with a great story this is a smaller restaurant longer than wide have been here several times and have never had a problem getting a seat by near the bar there are several tvs above the bar that show any sport or team you wish to see they have a great selection of rotating beers local and other - approximately 20 there is a full bar if the beer doesn't suit your fancy the food is very good - as we shared a chilli cheese dog and cucumber salad they advertise their hot dogs as vienna beef 9 wieners the only downfall here is that i find the food to be a little pricey for the area parking around can be tough as there is no designated parking lot i haven't had to park more than a block away by parking down one of the sides streets 
we held our wedding rehearsal dinner and guest welcome reception with a full restaurant buy out for the evening here both events were tremendous successes from the delicious food bar service and incredible service staff the team at hedge row kayla lauren and lateef were so helpful with the planning of this very important event 
i'm not really that much into ribs but i do like the ribs here they are quite tasty and not just slobbered up with sauce like most places the beef brisket was okay i was a little disappointed because it was really dry the pulled chicken was pretty juicy and good got the sweet potatro fries and the green beans you can't go wrong with these sides and well the fried corn on the cob was interesting but not that much to my liking and i'm actually a little disappointed about the supposed hot sauce it's hardly hot maybe i came in with way too much expectation because i saw it on the food network before i arrived in st louis or maybe it's because i'm not the biggest fan of bbq as it is there was a nice man who made sure that our food was good i assume he is the owner and i love when owners do that it just shows how fine of an establishment it is i was about to just give it 3 stars but i'll give it another because i love friendly owners and oh plus it takes a lot for me to like ribs and this is probably the only place that i will ever enjoy ribs in oh and i don't know what it's like on busy nights but the night that i went as soon as me and my friends go to a table our food was quickly delivered that was quite possibly the fastest service outside of fastfood joints ever sooo okay 4 stars 
sunday brunch actually had open table reservations for a place across the street that was literally empty so we looked at the crowd on the corner a no brainer seated inside although the do have a great patio party of 5 no problem food was great service top notch selection was varied drinks good i think i was pleasantly surprised by the quality definitely to become apart of our sunday rotation kudos the the gamblin brothers for taking an iconic central west end corner and keeping the food legacy alive 
big woods is a beautifully designed restaurant nestled on the corner of main street in the heart of the racing capital of the world many people complain about the service but i haven't really had an issue it's a popular place and if you have ever been a server you can empathize in my opinion the food is worth the wait i'm absolutely crazy about their grilled chicken and asparagus sandwich their nachos and mac n cheese are pretty great too their beer selection is decent but the atmosphere and food is all worth it 
me and my boyfriend love this place we have tried other mexican restaurants from indy to carmel and nothing compares to this place the food is always great and the staff is so friendly and nice we're always extremely satisfied after every time we eat here 
visiting from fort lauderdale florida amazing place great food awesome service we were seated right away place was packed we arrived today and had no clue where to go if you're visiting nashville this place is awesome 
so i wanted to like this place so much more than i did -- we came in with a fairly large party and the staff was super accommodating honestly staff was legit amazing but when we started ordering that was the issue i ordered drinks more than once and it took forever for them to arrive then food -- we got some fresh guacamole for the table and that was totally worth it if you are going here honestly just do this and don't order anything else i ended up going with the fish tacos since i'm a huge fan of mango but wow they were bad like really bad a good fish taco has shredded fish like other ground meat or pork mixed in with the seasonings and other items these were literally a chunk of fish on top of the taco and overcooked at that basically inedible to me i also thought the plate came with beans but it didn't apparently because i asked for some and they appeared but then i was charged an additional 5 for a side of refried beans ended up being one of my more expensive tabs in st pete on my visit and by far one of the most disappointing 
i wasn't a fan of cajun food before coming here--i'm still not really a fan--but i did enjoy the vegetarian pasta my husband got the gumbo appetizer and blackened shrimp po'boy the po' boy wasn't too great neither the fries the gumbo was decent though and the service--fantastic sheena our waitress was excellent as was the doorman whose name i didn't catch toting a toddler around bourbon street is not easy and they made it less awkward and were accommodating thank you 
we had to wait a bit to be seated we were quoted you will wait on either side of 20 minutes this was a new phrase to me but we ended up waiting on the longer tail end of that quote i believe we sat after 45 minutes of waiting once you walk behind the velvet curtain drape you are taken into the speakeasy type vibe one center bar with stools in the center and dimly candle lit booths line all the outside walls the drink menu is about six crafted cocktails per liquor so you will definitely find something you like we all ended up going with the famous bacon old fashioned do it like us you will not regret it not even the second one you order worth checking out if you have time to linger before 
the best before we moved to philly we used to stop at grindcore on tour with our band even if we didn't have a show booked in town love this place and we're fortunate to have bought a rowhouse nearby it's our cheers here are the main great things the staff -- all so friendly they'd give a treat to our late senior dog whenever we stopped by and are always kind the food i love the selection of baked goods like cakes cookies dottie's donuts and cannolis also love their herbivorious butcher sandwiches the place even if you're not a fan of the grindcore genre itself the music is never too loud and there is ample seating in their comfy back room we're fortunate to have this coffee shop in our town 
been buying stuff hf for years its a toy store for tool-heads like me however buyer beware some tools are pure crap either not working at all or not lasting very long ive had good luck with the 10 inch sliding radial arm saw i bought 6 years ago still works its sunday and im leaving the house now to go buy some sandpaper 
when you're cleaning your super cool lightweight 2 5 eyephorics glasses and don't realize your own strength and bust the nose pad off thank god i work 2 blocks from the ossip on the circle - walked in and my doc dr julie weibert was behind the counter and greeted me by my first name and asked the general manager lauren to help me in and out in less than 5 minutes and no charge score 
great selection of sours and interesting beers i would have given it 5 stars except the bartender was a jerk and treated the customers as beneath him 
best mex food i've had in nashville music on the weekends is great the service is great the margaritas are amazing please stop by you won't regret it 
great food great service great atmosphere we will definitely be back an awesome way to celebrate our anniversary 
love the homey feel of the union tap house definitely have the best wings in manayunk and all the food is really good the people who work the bar are really nice and even though it gets busy they always pay attention to customers 
excellent food and service family run which we like not a chain restaurant which is hard to find these days best asian food in tucson that we've found highly recommend 
drew and his staff especially nicole and savannah are simply awesome fair fast and great communication came and got our 31 pull behind trailer got the parts in fast and could not have been nicer thank you 
friendly servers and staff good food and good cocktails if you're looking for a healthier option amidst the many bars and eateries give this place a try 
i ordered through grubhub and although one of orders was incorrect fuku was quick to send me the correct roll in a timely manner they even threw in a miso soup sushi was good too 
i had quit going to big lot stores a couple of years ago because i felt the stores had become dirty and disorganized we had some time to spend before the movie started so we decided to go into big lots and look around i was shocked i honestly wasn't sure where i was this was not the big lots i used to go into this store was clean neat perfectly organized and very spacious they had furniture in the back that looked like furniture you would find in an upscale furniture store my wife and i really liked one of the dinette sets and agreed that this was just what we were looking for this store had really nice merchandise that anyone would be proud to display in their home if you are like me and had stopped shopping at big lots please give this store a try i know i will be shopping there from now on 
hi i m very disappointed my family went to this place and i have visit this place a few times but my mother went there and she was saying how the food was taste old and nasty my father was there too and he ended up in the bathroom the rest of the evening now why they still charged them after all that i promised you i won't be going there anymore nasty place have some respect for the puerto rican culture and do be cheap and start cooking fresh food thank you for you time
extremely disgusted with this doctor my daughter had been to see her before and the service aspect had been pretty poor my wife got sick and we tried to schedule an appointment as well at first they told us they had several openings but then they told us that since it was for my wife not my daughter we would qualify as a new patient so she refused to see us we were told the doctor will only take up to 2 new patients a day so she had several spots to see us but refused to see my sick wife because that's their policy the hippocratic oath is very clear that medical practitioners vow to serve all sick and injured a vow she clearly does not take seriously her policy was more important to her than helping my wife absolutely disgusting and i'm surprised her medical license hasn't been suspended yet 
barbie is a hottie this place needs to serve alcohol immediately because we ran out by the second hour had a great time and will return soon thank you
i was on 4th and saw this place the smell drew me in the doughnuts are huge and they have a delicious variety they also carry some old style soda beverages to wash it all down we ended up getting a half dozen to try some out mmmmmm tasty
i am really sad that i have to drop ginza down to 2 stars the food has never been spectacular but the service has always been wonderful and this was where i first met my fiance the old owners always remembered us and would always come by our table for a little chat and i noticed it wasn't just us they would make rounds to check on other customers oh how i miss them ginza is now under new management and they have new staff we ordered our usual dragon roll spicy tuna roll and ginza roll the rolls were tiny and not put together very well and we were suspious about the spicy tuna roll because it look more like salmon inside the roll than tuna after taking a bite we knew for sure that it was salmon and not tuna the wait person told the sushi chef that we had asked for spicy tuna and not salmon and he said that it was tuna not salmon he yelled over the bar it is tuna i got it out of the bag labeled tuna what the heck he got it out of the bag labeled tuna and then proceeded to glare at us and i'm just assuming cuss at us in chinese all i could understand was something in chinese tuna more stuff in chinese ha salmon and even more stuff in chinese i couldn't believe how abusive he was to us when the order was clearly wrong we calmly got up and went to the front to pay for our food girl at the counter asked us was everything good i replied with dismay not so much girl at the counter great come again really yeah we're not coming there again i would have dropped them down to 1 star but i'm adding a star for the memories 
i have never refused any dish that i have ever been served in 28 years - varying across a multitude of cultural abnormalities the potak soup was inedible- i could not bring myself to even take a second bite of it on the plus side the server graciously did not charge me for it however the massaman curry was the worst i have ever had and i must have had eatwn at 30 different places the squid in the curry tasted and smelled as if it came from the bait shop down the street the pad thai was by far the worst ever as well when we arrived the place was empty but before we left surprisingly the place was packed people in the area must not know what good or even great thai food should taste like i will never return let alone ever recommend anyone i would give this a half star if possible solo based on the courteous staff 
fellow new yorker approves i love this place not only the food is great but the customer service is awesome fun guys great pizza can't go wrong 
came here on the recommendation of a friend we bought the half baked brownie and a french press cupcake the half baked brownie was ridiculously good it's an almond cake with cookie dough in the center topped with chocolate frosting and caramel syrup the french press was also quite good a chocolate cake with coffee infused and a chocolate frosting as well great place to stop by 
great bbq with solid ambiance unique sauce which complimented the brisket would definitely hold its own in texas 
the place was busy but we didn't see the waiter in the room for over 10 minutes had to flag down the hostess to get coffee funny he showed up behind her as she was pouring food is overall average some of my fruit was over ripe to the point of spoiled egg white omelette with salsa was very good think it has gone downhill don't think i'll be back soon my friends thought it was just ok also 
i am a 10 year resident of montecito and have often chosen jeanine's for breakfast or lunch simply due to convenience the food has never been very good it's often greasy and tasteless but location in montecito is good that said almost every time i go i am met with a slow inefficient line to make my order nasty cashiers who often tell me to not bother to order unless i have secured a seat and slow and often incompetent service again all for food that is average at best it would be nice if the staff was polite and efficient and actually cared about the relatively high-end patrons who they serve go to jeanine's to see and be seen but don't expect anything but average to sub-par food and customer service 
very yummy cupcakes and cake pops i had the vanilla cupcake the frosting was super and the cake was so moist strawberry cake pop was wonderful 
in my year of living across from mix i kept going because i would pretty much only ever get takeout and the pizza is good what i will say is that i still don't get how these people have jobs they openly yell at each other in front of guests berating one another constantly giving each other dirty looks flirting with each other at the register seems pretty dysfunctional and some of the waitresses are really moody even when they're waiting on you this goes for both the dining area and the bar area so uncomfortable 
it was a good place to stop and grab a drink but not much more than a hole in the wall we were the only ones in there besides one other 
the atmosphere was amazing the service was great first mexican place i've been to in so long in philly that has horchata and at that it was delicious me and a friend split the chicken nachos i can't remember the exact name but we dogged them they were the highlight super delicious we split chicken and steak tacos which were packed and with lots of flavor highly recommend
always a loyal steak and shake fan but this particular place could use a personality 
this place is a hidden little central american getaway upon sipping my mint lemonada i was instantly transported to my favorite hideaway in costa rica the tangy icy minty flavor is not so perfect on a chilly december night but it just so happens to be an odd 50 degree december night so why not reminisce my costa rican visits with this yummy icy drink right i shared the smoked scallop avocado quinoa salad pozole special and la gallina and was very fond of each the pozole was very hearty and delicious definitely recommend my 6 month old couldn't get enough of the mean green smoothie and guacamole the atmosphere was delightful very clean and very good service the owner is extremely kind and holds a great conversation my husband and i both enjoyed an excellent cappuccino and latte on the way home go for the soy coconut latte you won't regret it it was a great family dinner looking forward to returning to try some more treats from the menu 
the chips and salsa were decent my drink which was made with tequila citrus juices and a splash of soda was pretty good anything positive ends there our entrees there were four of us were unimpressive food was bland flavorless we will not be returning 
decent bbq place for price got the 2 meat combo with 2 sides ribs were dry rubbed but not very tender good amount of meat on it but i've had better the brisket was excellent great bark and no sauce needed but there were some tasty options available it did look like it'd been sitting on the warmer for quite some time but i did come in during their last hour and it didn't affect the taste the truffle mac n cheese may not be for everyone saw a kid return his because it didn't taste like the blue box stuff but i thought it was amazing the baked beans were on point as well had better before but these were pretty good too they've got plenty more on the menu but i'd ask to see the meat before selecting it 
afshan is a sweet darling woman and she has a gift my sister and i treated ourselves to henna and we were very lucky to have found henna me beautiful during our stay in santa barbara you can choose to do something traditional or let afshan create a freestyle design we chose freestyle and i'm still admiring her work also she shared a story with me about learning how to do henna from her mother and how her toddler daughter likes to go around the house saying that she does henna super sweet will definitely hire her again when i'm in town and treating myself to body art 
duh who dont know hooters well this one is sooo close to the stadium and the staff is fine as heck love it
very good pizza and the price was just right one thing is that the girl on the phone was a tad rude but to her defense it was a saturday night it was probably busy
came armed with some coupons from recyclebank one for buy two pancakes and get two free and the other for buy one breakfast sandwich and get another free the pancakes are whole wheat so you don't feel as miserable about yourself while eating them and are really really good fluffy yummy the works i would definitely take them over their regular non-whole-grain counterpart i got seitan for the breakfast sandwich i'm not a vegetarian but i love seitan definitely try it it was very good there the place itself is really intimate would be a great date spot for a trendy hipster-friendly other very cheap cute decor cute facade as well i really love this place not just somewhere to eat but the kind of place that is exciting to go as well 
solid pizza joint husband and i split the house special pizza and cheese bread appetizer - both delicious reminds me of pizza i used to love at pie in the sky in midtown the small 12 was plenty big for two of us - we brought home leftovers two desserts shared with friends - the butterscotch bread pudding and caramel brownie yum really good our server was super sweet and a real pro she gave us some history on the restaurant - it's been family owned for generations the interior is very modern makes for a great date spot in hermitage will definitely be back 
this place is your go to for anything you need for running the staff is probably the friendliest i've ever met and they really do want to help you find what you are looking for i have never had a bad experience here and always know i will receive good service and find qualify products 
freshly made juice similar to ones at wholefoods slow service because only 1 person works there 
our tourer guide from tours by foot recommended this place the pi a coladas were scrumptious 
there are so few bbq options in goleta i was really hoping this place would be good it wasn't the food was mediocre and the service stunk it took forever to place an order and the tables were dirty on top of everything else it seems way too expensive for what you get i would not recommend this place 
best street style tacos in town service was great as usual i'm glad that i don't have to drive downtown anymore 
fresh very fresh oyster and tasty bbq oyster good service while the bread is a little bit too salty but other things are perfect
been wanting to try this place out for a while now at first it looks kind of sketchy but i was pleasantly surprised this is a family run and operated restaurant much prefer this over chain italian eateries cough cough og service was extremely proficient and fast honestly we were in fed and out within 45 minutes food wise it was good could have used more salt but when the majority of your clientele is over the age of 60 well i get it i had the house salad bread really really good and chicken fettuchini alfredo the pasta dish was big enough to share i think the alfredo sauce was made from scratch but not sure but even if it wasn't it was still very good all in all since i'm local the prices were right and l like pasta i'd be back 
as an alumna of this amazing university i can assure you a better school doesn't exist you can look but you won't find it 
this location use to be a rite-aid so its huge inside its usually a hit or miss with this place ive never found items for myself but the kids section has a nice selection i usually can find some long sleeve or short sleeve shirt and a pair of jeans or two the shoe selection is always busted as well as the toy selection for the kids overall if your looking for kids clothing its a 40 chance youll find something i also donated to this location a few times and each time their employees have came out to help me carry the bags in which is nice
very good food at the mall and wanted to try it since i'm not a fan of the other foothills mall eateries very clean nice service too good music and sound system as well 
great food i am happy we finally got to check it out the green papaya salad with spicy level of 7 10 is good the ribs were good but tasted more like chinese style the ambiance is decent with pretty thai decor 
byob low key delicious food love love love this place it has become one of our favorite places to go for consistently good food as a greek armenian american family we are picky about our mediterranean food but this place is the real deal they are warm welcoming and fill your belly with delicious food some of our favorites include the baba ganoush falafel cauliflower dolmas and many of the chicken dishes i saw a plate of octopus pass me by last time that i am looking forward to trying on our next visit wonderful hidden gem 
best fish tacos we love this place it's really tiny so not the best place if you are coming with a group 
me and my girlfriend went to the capital grill for my birthday dinner i have to say that from the montment we walked in we where taken care of the hostess got my name it took 10 minutes to get are table then the service started they had a card on the table wishing me a happy birthday that was great then our waiter bob ballard 5 star bob welcome us to the capital grill and wish me a happy birthday the drinks and the food was excellent you must go at lest once in your life time to experience a great dinner ask for bob a great waiter and excellent service 5 stars for the capital grill i'll be back 
although this place seems chain it is more akin to home cooked mom and pop place the customer service is amazing and the food is great and so is the bakery goods i order togo from here a lot and it's always on par and greeted with a smiling helpful face thank you 
the best mexican food i have had in a while the flavors are out of this world and the atmosphere is authentic and fun the only downside was that the parking was limited and very frustrating 
friends don't let friends drink charbucks try caffe maida for some first-class real-deal italian espresso drinks and delicious gelato and pastries mostly bindi - but still fine i had an iced coffee pretty basic i know and it was terrific clean digs including the restroom and viceland on tv i was so pleased 
kobe beef is wonderful served just the way i like it thanks tim tatiana and lara very sweet thanks again 
my wife and i decided to visit new orleans for out anniversary and booked the q c because of proximity to the french quarter i have to say that i was impressed with the service the friendliness and then over all hotel experience that the q c provided the rooms were immaculate the door men were friendly and the front desk personnel we're great if you're looking for boutique hotel within walking distance to the quarter definitely consider the q c 
called to order wouldnt give us the tv special had to go online they got both pizzas wrong called to complain they gave me the 3rd degree put another person on phone 3rd degree again offered to give us one free topping on a pizza in the future seriously finally said to just remake n deliver it had to return old messed up pizza then delivery guy gave us the 3rd degreeagain now im pissed and not hungry thanks dear imos customer service keeps customers your pizza aint that good ever tried pieology 
really nice location on the campus of drexel university parking is limited there is a big dining area upstairs so you can bring a friend or 10 can be crowded during lunchtime so make sure you get the right order mine got mixed up with someone else's during the lunch rush the new-since january- fried chicken sandwich is awesome i love you potato bun but it's a small chicken patty so if your hungry get two the crinkle cut fries are delish no comment on the burger- you should already know how awesome it is 
this place was newly remodeled and super packed the service from the older hardcore viet servers are more rough they have more attitude and less patience when you ask a question i'd go later at night when the younger crowd is around i would only get the real vietnamese dishes and noodle don't try their viet chinese wannabe rice plates or pan fried noodles it's bland grilled beef with lemon grass is super sweet beef comes with a lot of meat and a little bowl of rice the spring rolls are good and so is the peanut sauce but seems smaller than what i get from frisco but just as fresh i don't usually eat potstickers but this place was ok they have a very good sweet soy sauce that goes with it yum 
i'm never going back here i used to be an infrequent regular only do my nails sporadically i decided to bring my almost 3 year old for her first pedicure--which i explained to the manager my daughter's pedicure lasted maybe 8 minutes and then she asked to get her nails painted the woman walked away refusing to paint her finger nails she said my daughter was moving too much which i'm sure that she was still they were really not nice to my toddler and then still charged me for the 25 pedicure i asked to speak to the manager who was equally terrible and unwilling to recognize that my daughter did not receive a 25 pedicure i would have paid 10 15 even they were so awful i stormed out and will never go there again i haven't received such terrible customer service in my 15 years of getting pedicures and to a two and a half year old girl 
we went here yesterday june 23 2017 after being seated we waited 15 minutes for someone to even take our drink order no one even acknowledged that we there someone eventually came over and took our drink order but told us she wasn't our waitress and couldn't take our food order finally 10 minutes later we got our drinks and the same lady took our food order the tuscan chicken pizza was not good the cocktail was over priced- 11 for one drink the peel and eat shrimp was 4 higher then other restaurants the bartender questioned why i asked her for limes instead of my waitress who actually brought lemons even though i asked for lime towards the end of our time there a waitress finally came over to see if we had been helped horrible horrible service 
looooovvvveeeee this place emmet is my favorite bartender and their irish coffees are on point kudos oh and great karaoke 
everyone knows how much i loooooooooove pho it's my weekend detox from having a good friday or saturday night or both haha well the next time you're in the area make sure to give this little hole in the wall a visit i always say the hole in the wall restaurants are the best and this confirms my theory start off with some imperial rolls grab a large number 1 w egg noodles of course maybe get a rice plate as well and don't even worry about the tab this place has fantastic food at a wallet friendly price pho sho 
truly a st pete hidden gem very little signage outside but it is located inside the racquet club we always sit outside in the courtyard area which is also dog friendly the owner is very nice wonderful service great food and good prices can't go wrong for lunch or dinner they also serve kahwa coffee which is always a plus 
we were in fishers at mashctaft brewery and wanted to get take out food for dinner we noticed thai kitchen as we pulled in the parking lot and it made our decision easy for some reason the phone number online didn't work so we walked down from the brewery to put in an order it was ready about 30 minutes later which seemed reasonable for a saturday night there are 2 classic thai dishes that i always order for take out - pad thai with tofu and red curry with chicken both were big portions and we had leftovers for the next day the red curry had amazing creamy coconut flavors with a little bite of basil it was delicious over the rice the pad thai was tasty but not my favorite pad thai i've had the sauce seemed a little off to me i like my noodles very saucy but this seemed more on the dry side the tofu was a good addition to the dish overall great carry out option 
the service here was god awful i was really expecting an experience the hey guys is this your first time here let me explain this type of thing and didn't get that at all the waiter was completely unfriendly rushed and seemed upset when we asked anything i eventually asked the hostess what to do and she explained everything then suggested getting extra sides because they were included with combo c we finally struggle through dinner and receive the bill only to find we were charged for every single side truly disappointed i was hoping for a high end great date or social dinner spot and it was a complete letdown 
response time was great over text and phone we exchanged some photos and information and brian picked up my stuff later the same day reasonable cost and did what he said he would do would recommend 
best dang good hot dog ever who knew i loved the rolls that open in the top and grilled to perfection everything and everyone at this location are awesome 
i visited here on a recent trip to new orleans and asked my waitress about a special i saw advertised and she informed me that she was new and wasn't sure so she asked her manager that is no problem at all but later during conversation she told me that she had been working at the restaurant for over a year the girls here were not all that cute and the whole time i was there the waitresses were yelling across the restaurant at the cooks about personal business which i found somewhat unprofessional as far as the food goes it arrived in a timely manner and i had no complaints about it i do feel though that the whole hooters brand needs a makeover and revamped menu with better options 
i visited local honey while visiting a friend in nashville for a few days after learning about it on yelp i found the cutest stuff - 2 super cute shirts and the best dress i've ever owned it has bicycles on it all for 55 awesome 
so i have been here several times in the past and while the wines were ok it was always hit or miss with staffing and their never seemed to be anything happening we stopped in after an update to their facebook and am happy to say it looks like they have new management ownership and they seem to be making some changes and updates this is great because the location is really nice and their wines have potential they are changing the hours and adding some events and bringing their tasting room a little more up to date already noticed a change in the atmosphere and will be going back to see how things are coming along 
super delicious we got beignets here during mardi gras we waited a long time in line but crowds were huge in town that day the beignets are wonderful what are they shaped like a little pillow a bit heavier and denser than a donut served warm coated with sprinkles of powdered sugar outstanding 
i wanted to try this place this morning i arrived at about 11am stood at the counter while two employees weighed stuff in the back each employee separately came out front looked directly at me yet neither could muster a greeting before turning around and going back to weighing i waited a couple more minutes and still no service not even a hello we'll be right with you so i left absolutely rude and horrible business 
so i figure- when a company steps up we're really happy but we don't always take the time to acknowledge it so i wanted to take a moment and relay my recent experience with southeastern salvage now we all go here because we feel like we can get really cool stuff cheap- and some of it is seconds or distressed inventory- but you can also buy things like iron doors most iron door companies are going to expect 7500 and up for a large set of double iron doors- which includes installation s e s sells these doors - but you have to install them yourself- well if you are so inclined you can buy these doors for around 4k- about a 1000 cheaper than the next cheapest i have found so we decided to try and do our own install the doors weigh around 500lbs each and the frame is another 250 but its the fact that its 9' high by 6' wide that makes it really unruly so you get the idea this is not an installation for the faint of heart we spent an entire day prepping and finishing the install- the following day when i started to install the hardware we realized the strike plate had been drilled 1 off center- translation the door was completely useless arrrrrrgh because the doors are handmade- there is no guarantee that one door will fit another frame properly- the whole thing has to come out i went back the next day- and they had a second door that was identical- which they sold me and assured me that when i returned the faulty door they would give me a full refund then next morning i showed up with the faulty door and they had it off my trailer in 10 min- fully refunded the price of the door- and refunded an additional 10 off the damaged door- and i did not ask for that 400 refund now while i wasn't thrilled about having to do a few extra hours of work with such a heavy door- it turned out to be an additional 2 hrs- and 400 made it a bit more palatable this place can be have a hard edge not unlike the city of newyork- but they are really great when it comes to stuff like this- they were as helpful as they could possibly be treated me with respect- and did everything they said they would do thats about as much as you can hope for in a transaction i was nervous about buying such an expensive product from ses but no more as i mentioned - they do have an edge- but like my friends on the east coast- when you really are in need they step up 
my first time - it's in a small strip mall and very unassuming- wow - so amazing - can't wait to come back come early when the food is gone it closes so good really owners are so sweet 
i don't really believe in giving negative reviews biggest reason is because i know somewhere down the line there was someone who worked and dreamt hard to start each and every business i'm always happy with the food and service at the tucker establishments i was however very surprised and disappointed that there was not a changing table in the restroom for me to change my son probably not up to health code that i was forced to do so on one of the booths sincerely a mom who loves steak
love this chipotle nice atmosphere cool staff quick in and out service
bare-bones counter-service spot with delicious fried chicken the place is new orleans themed they also have king cake and there is a ton of decorations all over the seats and tables are very basic and the tables have a ton of different hot sauces for the chicken as well as coloring books for kids there is also a ton of other basic dipping sauces in the fridge next to the counter in addition to fried chicken they also have a couple of seafood options and a bunch of sides i got their lunch special 4 pieces of fried chicken a side and soda with a side of coleslaw the coleslaw was decent but the fried chicken was phenomenal it was fried to perfection and i would describe it as lightly fried it reminded me of the frying on mcdonald's chicken nuggets and it had the perfect amount of crunch on the outside while remaining moist on the inside the food was prepared extremely quickly within 5 min as well
we'd seen great reviews about the burgers from burgerim we were glad to learn they would deliver to our neighborhood in wingfield springs and even more glad after we tasted their food after looking at the menu on their website we decided to order two trios of sliders so we could try all the different hamburgers they offer in these trying times little things like trying new food seem extra fun as a quick review we liked all the things we ordered the lamb and the salmon burgers were tasty and a nice change from a traditional burger all the beef options were yummy the fries are unique and i won't explain why so as not to spoil your food adventure the onion rings are delicious we chose to get the combos which come with a drink so we ordered milkshakes i got a strawberry milkshake and hubby got the chocolate what a delicious treat we were so stuffed from the trio of sliders that we couldn't finish our milkshakes so we put them in the freezer to enjoy the next day the person who took our order and delivered our food was named lindsey she was wonderful and what she told us is what made us extremely glad we ordered food there she said the owner had kept all the staff on at their regular wages and was working hard to continue to do so as an employee she expressed how caring and compassionate the owner was this is a very worthwhile place to support indeed burgerim at outlets at legends 1180 scheels drive suite b108 sparks 89434 775 420-5433
we picked the bercy on a whim for dinner and had a lovely meal first the space is very cool modern and mostly black and white with cool lighting and cool art - i really enjoyed the vibe a lot it felt very chic for food we had several items that were really excellent -the bread basket it's not often i mention the bread basket but it was great bread -i can't resist a good steak tartare and this one was a very good rendition pretty classic -i had the bet salad which was absolutely delicious five stars for the salad -tuna au poivre which was lovely -the profiteroles - my husband definitely had ordering envy this is a must dessert so good five stars items i would skip the oysters were probably the most disappointing thing we had which was so sad but they were really just kind of flavorless and meh compared to what we pay for oysters it was a deal but i would skip those unless the quality improves the creme brulee was fine but in retrospect i would have ordered a second profiteroles instead but a lovely relaxed meal we'd definitely come back 
5 star dave was our server and is the reason this is our favorite sushi place in all of st louis the man redefines service and deserves twice whatever he is making incredible recommendations fantastic customized drinks above and beyond customer service ask for him to be your server you'll be impressed
first place i've ever gone where the tuna wasn't mixed with mayonnaise nothing like a dry lump of tuna on a roll absolutely disgusting at least say something if that's how you make it too many other places around that make good sandwiches 
i had the opportunity to visit the shop today with my ford f-150 i was impressed with the professionalism of the staff and the care in which they took of my vehicle they show me the old and new parts and the prices were very reasonable thanks mike jamie yousif and jose you guys rock 
this jewelry store has everything it has a huge selection of gemstones diamonds turquoise and pearls both employees were really nice and helpful its a gorgeous store and i could've spent hours in here looking they have a 50 off section which happened to have the perfect gift for my mom i really recommend this place 
it's not an inexpensive salad let's get that out of the way but there are so many options for you to build a salad unique to your tastes i like that you can pick salads with hot protein or a protein plate or a half salad with a half sandwich or soup they have a good selection of soups and the service is fast there is a loyalty program that allows you to check in eventually you get a free salad and they text you deals to entice you to come back in overall the food is fresh the rolls are good and it's the one place in town where you'll actually see this veggie-hater eat a salad it is a great place for a light lunch in the cool springs area and i've never had an issue with parking or finding a place to sit the only thing i don't love about this place you bus your own tray and the size of the tray plates and stickiness of salad bits onto those plates makes it a little cumbersome to try to dump your tray while holding other stuff in one hand etc it's an awkward balancing act if you're trying to take your drink purse with you in the other hand firstworldproblems so really not a ding on this place i guess 
super friendly staff we have been a couple of times and taken our kids as well the chorus of yums starts at the appetizers and continues into our variety of orders most of our family love the usual chinese fare general tso chicken orange beef kung pao chicken and my favorite shrimp fantasia great atmosphere we will be back 
this hungry howies saved my family's thanksgiving due to a death in the family we had to drive over 19 hours on thanksgiving day obviously we were unable to prepare a traditional thanksgiving meal and nothing was open thanks to this hungry howies we were able to eat a hot meal together after tragedy the service was excellent and the pizza reminded me of my childhood wishing for a hungry howies in new york one day 
after three separate visits to the bungalow over about a year my experiences have been consistently solid whether i was on my own and just grabbing a quick dinner having drinks and appetizers with someone at the bar or more recently calling ahead to pick-up brunch on a sunday i've been a happy customer the employees have all treated me well and the food and drink is reasonably priced for that part of the tampa bay area i also really appreciate how they have the live music outside but keep doors shut to the inside bar dining room for those of us who prefer a quieter atmosphere parking is limited but that's about as common for a bar restaurant south of kennedy as the bucs not selling out a football game while the bungalow is not exactly my home away from home i'm sure i'll visit them at least three more times in the next year with the expectation of more good service and well-prepared menu items 
it's now 2019 and we were experiencing a slow leak in one of our tires the crew at creamery had a busy morning but took a look anyway i told them i thought we had a bent room they could have said yes to that and charged me they could have sold me a new tire but it turned out to be simple corrosion they cleaned it and resealed the tire in about 20 minutes and only charged 15 i love this place and these guys knowledgeable fast and honest 
the food here is fresh and tasty my favorite thing on the menu is the thai bowl some of the bowls have very strong flavors but you can order the sauce on the side i also recommend ordering extra rice because they don't add very much at the bottom of the bowl i definitely recommend this place 
excited to see this place in my town it's cute on the outside and in drinks are good food is mediocre and taseless which is a shame as they have everything else down including the young crowd young people love good food and authenticity central if you see this review contact me for a slight menu revamp i'm a culinary professional and can help you out would probably only be back for a drink nothing more 
it's a new little spot that nobody knows about it's very small but the food pretty good they want had crawfish on here i just wish they had all the times as for the banh mi i wasn't so happy with that because they put soy sauce in my hoague which fukkks up eveyhtunf uggg yuck on a positive note they do have amazing drinks
we looked into several on yelp and jaime responded very quickly with a quote on the mailbox faster than i could have imagined he said he would come between 8-8 30 and he was there promptly and they did a great job he walked my husband through to look at the work and we were extremely pleased i would highly recommend jr sealing for a quality job reliable from start to finish and professional experience 
went to louie's for happy hour they have an extensive wine selection a few speciality cocktails and a couple rotating craft beer selections between the two of us we tried 4 different wines and all were delicious the happy hour red was a grenache which is my favorite red and it didn't disappoint we started with squeaky cheese and tuna nachos both excellent after sitting and enjoying the not too quiet not to loud setting for a little while we decided to try their charcuterie board and brussels we loved them both honestly the place is not near where we typically hang out so i can't see myself choosing to come back but it was an enjoyable experience and i'd definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the area 
we picked this place because it was close to the airport but away from the city and it blew us away the bbq mac and cheese was possibly the best i have ever had it has won awards and i believe it i don't know what it was but i liked the spoon clean the fried green tomatoes were perfection the remolade splice but balances the bbq sampler was all good the pound cake was light and rich at the same time but that mac and cheese 
the management at this home depot is so hardworking they have pockets of dedicated employees and they are solidly stocked they volume of the roosevelt boulevard seems to exceed the volume of this location i am sharing that because you can visit this store during various time periods without being trapped in very long lines to check out conversely returns and special order issues can take a substantial amount of time there are issues such as shrinkage from broken items and of course customers returning broken merchandise which can lead to really frustrating purchases but the management is very receptive to these issues and the handle them professionally i have managed several large rehabs so over a 6 month period i've completed in excess of 12k of purchases from this home depot there are some really hardworking and proactive employees here but genuine shot out to doug and o'kello i watched this manager allow a desperate customer in at the closing time to make a purchase i am not recommending this but it is rare that you can find a large chain in a city treating customers with the type of care typically associated with small town mom and pop shops 
kristyn is by far one of my favorite and easiest vendors i worked with during my planning process from my first contact with her to her follow up email after the wedding everything was flawless during my trial kristyn began by really getting to know me as a person- who i was what do i do how i normally wear my makeup etc through that she was able to look at my inspo pictures and give suggestions on what i might like during the trial she was patient with me and was willing to make changes based on my feedback to create the perfect look i had my engagement pictures taken the same day so we were able to see how the look photographed and i was able to send additional feedback after the trial based on how the makeup lasted throughout our photo session on the day of our wedding kristyn and her assistant penelope were amazing they were fun to chat with nailed the looks both me and my bridal party wanted and were overall fantastic kristyn also makes her own lip product so i was able to order custom lip colors for me and my girls to add to their bridesmaid gift so they can remember our wedding every time they wear their lip color it was a great touch as a fellow wedding vendor i would highly recommend kristyn and her team 
trustworthy customer driven and quick response time products very good reliable 
friendly staff nice latte they have simple syrup a big plus on our book i don't remember what the name of the donuts were but taking the first bite into a soft inside and a almost crispy textured outer layer in some places yum highly frosted but not an overwhelming frosting taste was heaven my partner and i just sat and enjoyed that first bite for a moment watching he sun go down there seemed to be just the slightest hint of anise and i am hooked we have yet to try the next one it's a blueberry powdery mix that we can't wait to get our teeth into thank you for a great experience when in town we will be back for sure
marco's was very delicious i went on a thursday night which are half price martini's - definitely a win in my book the martini's were really good as well i loved paying half price for a quality martini i got the pesto pasta and added shrimp to it it was pure deliciousness probably my favorite pesto pasta i've had in a while it was a huge portion as well so i really feel like i got my money's worth the only bad part of my experience was that my friend told the server i was done while i was in the bathroom so they threw away half of my pasta and i was definitely planning on taking it home but that's my friends fault not the restaurant - i was so sad haha the atmosphere is romantic but casual i want to come back when that patio is open it looks super cute out there i'll definitely be back for that pesto pasta again i'm craving it again already 
it was my first time there one of my coworkers raved about it in these covid 19 times i'm cautious to try new places but accepted her recommendation and tried the pork with pate and extra veggies after placing our orders we waited outside on the picnic tables about 10 or so minutes later one of the young ladies brought our food to us the way the sandwich was stuffed i was unable to taste each ingredient in each bite with reassembling it next time i'll try it with the regular serving of veggies to compare the only downside was the small parking lot 
right off concord pike sits this little hotdog and chicken shack what a combo called johnnie's the walls of the joint are covered with photos of smiling customers doubling down on their 13 dogs as well as their other specialties their menu includes all variations of hot dogs that you can think of some classics that you probably know like the chicago dog the chili cheese dog and the texas tommy but their menu also includes other fun creations or variations that i've just never heard of like the southern comfort and the tijuana dog my dad raves about this place and makes my mom stop here any and every time they're in the area we have yet to try their fried chicken but it looks pretty good i got the 13 texas tommy wrapped in bacon deep fried and then covered in cheese wiz i'm very picky about cheese wiz-- i know cheese wiz is a cheap alternative but some cheese wiz just does not compare to others in quality johnnie's has some top notch cheese wiz and the dog was still juicy but not greasy after being deep fried the dog itself has a circumference of about an inch so this bad boy had some girth aside from length bonus points for also having veggie options i love places that are mostly meat based fare but they make an effort to include everyone 
this was my first time here the customer service is terrible especially from the male that calls himself a manager with the worst attitude and very disrespectful i didn't catch his name and i doubt he is even a manager will not be returning the smell is awful 
i absolutely hated the service here i came around 8 30 pm 30 mins till closing i was really looking for lace appliques and asked a woman if they had them there she asked her other co worker if they had them and she said no when i was about to leave the worker was checking out another costumer the costumer was asking for advice the worker of course replied i think its would look lovely with a lace applique in shock i was so upset they just told me they didn't have any needless to say it was terrible service and i will not return if i could i would give this place zero stars just terrible
worth the wait i would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area looking for a nice meal to have with a date or friends servers are continuously kind and helpful when taking orders would recommend the clam mussel appetizer to anyone that likes shellfish and if you feel like splurging request extra bread 
well now they aggravated me and as usual it's about money my dog is on medication for the first time in his life i looked online to price a refill and it is much cheaper than what these guys sold it to me so i placed an order the online service called msah to verify the prescription but msah refused to verify instead they require me to come to the clinic and pick up a written prescription to mail to the online service the reason they don't verify online is they can't verify the medication i am getting which makes no sense since they can't verify it either way the point is to make it as inconvenient for me as possible to shop online at reasonable prices rather than the prices msah charges so the result is i have to go out of my way and my dog misses a few days medication wow that's caring for your customers and patients 
got take out pizza from them during the pandemic and overall an ok experience but with good pizza ordered online which unfortunately a bit confusing we ordered a half half pizza and then immediately got a call saying that they were out of everything needed for the pizzas we ordered glad they called but it was frustrating that everything we got quite excited for their pizza flavors sound great wasn't available we picked up our pizzas - minimal contact which was nice unfortunately they completed messed up the order which we didn't realize til we got home they put the wrong extra toppings on the wrong sides of the pizza supposed to be ollie on one side with pepperoni banana peppers and mushrooms on the other ended up with the ollie with the banana peppers and mushrooms on that side and pepperoni on the other side the side with the pepperoni was actually delicious but the other side was quite overwhelming and too much sour flavor with the double olives and banana peppers overall the pizza was good with nice thin crust not too heavy on the grease and not too heavy on the toppings either price might seem steep for pizza but i felt it was worth it i just wish they had a way to update the website when they ran out of things and that they got the toppings right they also don't serve anything other than pizza if you good basic pizza thats not super fancy but just done well give them a try 
a coworker and i wanted something different other than fast food found hot tomato on yelp and we will be back again the food was yummy and so much food try the chicken salad 
i have been to the patterson house numerous times and i plan to keep going back i love the speakeasy style of ph and the drinks are splendid the really have done an amazing job training their staff the stingy brim is like a bolder white russian and it is fabulous seriously i think i am addicted the bacon old fashioneds are also a must-try the food was just ok to me but the drinks and atmosphere made up for that i also wish they would take reservations then i'd up my 4 stars to a million 
amazing candles and artwork very helpful to go there and good store hours a diverse supply of options and good prices now yelp is saying i haven't written enough so i'm going to write more in this paragraph even though i've said everything i wanted it's still shorter than most now it's average length 
the pj's itself is ok this is a retort to jen l who commented on what kind of parent buys their under 12 child a sugary coffee drink at night first off jen- this is prob the most irrelevant thing you could ever put in a review of a business not that my comment right here is relevant either- so i'll forgive that part else i'd be a hypocrite just couldn't figure out any other way to point out your blatant ignorance after reading what you wrote you probably don't have kids of your own those are usually the kind of people who make insane comments about other people's parenting now while i'm not defending buying children coffee late at night i am defending parents everywhere who just want to be left alone by insanely judgemental busybodys like you every parent has the right to raise their own children the way they want to in peace and if you were a parent yourself you should know and respect that otherwise i strongly fear for whatever kind of intolerance and ignorance you are subconsciously teaching your own children with this behavior as not just a parent but a human being with decency and respect for every person to live and let live however they choose if personally rather my kids have a dose of sugar one night than the kind of poison you're spewing out towards others but hey who am i to judge lol if you want to continue the cycle of ignorance that comes from not minding your own business than who am i to stop you most people would probably agree that it's those under-evolved individuals like yourself that are perpetuating all the hate in the world even with a petty comment like that and some might argue that those people should be quickly eliminated from the gene pool but not i jen l not i i respect your right to be a miserable judgemental you-know-what because you're too scared to look in the mirror and deal with your own self so you project your shortcomings on others and that's ok it's how humans have been psychologically reacting to other humans since the beginning but i am glad that my children are more evolved and bigger people with better things to do in the world at ages 7 and 1 than what you will ever be because it's their generation who will hopefully finally overcome the sheer stupidity pettiness of people like you and god forbid- any you might raise your ignorance is fuel to fire that more evolved humans are fighting so if that's the only purpose you want your pathetic existence to serve- than that's your prerogative i thank you for giving my kids and more noble people in the world something to work on this generation has got their work cut out for them with all the leftovers human rejects like you lingering around on the planet and i'm positive they will do it with far more grace than i could ever do so if they need a little coffee once in awhile hey none of your business these kids have a war to rage and all they have is love and compassion as weapons which don't work to well with ignorance like yours who don't understand it or even too well with defensiveness and disgust like i'm showing here even though i do have the capacity to understand it so that's a pretty big job yeah let the good mothers of the world treat their children however they wish and stay out of it the more prominently you stand in the way of understanding and the happiness of others the quicker the world will be rid of you and you'll be sick and miserable from your own venomous hateful poison and miserable by your intolerance until the day you finally gtfo of here and leave people alone if that's the life you want that's your freedom to choose it but the kids have enough to worry about so as a parent i beg you to get out of their way and let them be they have a huge mess to clean up that people like you just keep insisting on making worse i implore people like you to do 3 things 1 just try to be nice and mind your own business 2 if that is too hard maybe just get out of the way of human progress and hole up in a cave somewhere where you can be alone with your misery and not spreading the disease of ignorance to innocent people especially not the children and perhaps most important 3 please- for the love of god- do not reproduce or else the cycle continues longer than it ever should it already has by god if the kids need a coffee to clean up the mess people like you are perpetuating just by existing let him have it nobody asked you it's not your kid earth called it said please leave you are not wanted here idk how much more clear i can make myself but if i can just clear the way of one petty a-hole in this world so my children will have a better life in peace with other people than this rant or any others i ever make were worth it the kids are alright so are a lot of their parents prob that one included you're the problem what are you going to do about yourself 
we visited opry mills while it was raining heavily on a recent visit to nashville this mall is huge plus it has tons of outlet stores which sometimes equates to cheaper prices due to the large size the parking is a bit of a nightmare we didn't eat in the food court but it was very large with tons of options plus there were several sit down restaurants as well 
i love this place best donuts in philly hands down always baked fresh my absolute favorite is the blueberry fritter my other favorites include powdered jelly and mocha creme 
the food is really good but i every time i call in for a carry out order the person who answers the phone sounds like they hate their life on top of that when i go to pick up my order they look like they don't want to be there 5 star food 3 star customer service 
went here to bring my car for an oil change for the first time i had a nearly full dutch bros punch card on my console when i got there and it was gone when i left really your workers are so hard up they have to steal a punch card from your customers i called to report it to make sure the manager knew that things like this were happening and they had left for the day already before 5pm and they never returned my call despite leaving a message if little things like this happen on the regular just imagine what they must do with the rest of their service never coming here again such poor customer service 
i love it i go with my ex-bf all the time their buffet is awesome and totally afforded nice dessert and it's byob 
one of the better hungry howie's around quick delivery lots of toppings they don't skimp
have not been here in a few years what a big surprise they redecorated the whole interior to make it like a back east style small italian restaurant instead of the ordinary pizza place it was well the pizza was similar to that new york style i so much miss i will have to come back soon and try the rest of the food choices great find in tucson where these type places are so rare 
hands down one of the best experiences of my life - all thanks to annika from the first booking to the final stages of product selection annika thought of it all i had decided to this for myself - to help me feel more confident and comfortable with my own body annika truly embraced this and helped me at ease with every step of the journey 100 would not only recommend this to all my friends but i'd do it again in a heartbeat 
i eat here at least once a week the food is always excellent the service ranges from average to good its a great place to hang out downtown definitely worth going 
service was not even mediocre the waitress didn't ask if i wanted my leftovers to-go instead she threw out half my meal oh well didn't like it any way won't be back 
this was my second time eating persian food and the kabobs here are reallly good we had the barg and the koubideh both with beef and both were very delicious personally i like to barg better we also tried the doogh which was a persian drink carbonated salty yogurt drink its an interesting drink i would definitly go back to this place 
super yummy great customer service the friendly staff was somehow even more impressive than their stellar food the baked beans were particularly fantastic 
the saint was fantastic a burger topped with cheese bacon fried chicken and a potato pancake then topped with gravy generous portions and a friendly staff 
omg so delicious stopped for breakfast before heading home to san antonio and so glad we took the time to eat here absolutely on the list for our next visit to new orleans 
been here a couple times the first time i met a friend there and got waited on had a very good tenderloin that was meaty and seasoned my only issue was it literally took about 10 minutes just to pay my tab the bartender kept talking to her friends i verbally asked to pay and after about 5 minutes i raised my hand like i was in grade school so i haven't been in there for a couple months went back friday since i was over that way and wanted a tenderloin walked in at 1 30 still had some people eating but not packed i sat at the bar there was 6 or 7 other people at the bar i sat down looked right at the bartender which was a different lady she never once acknowledged me i sat there and watched her fill our her football parlay card and give it to some guy then she collected from another patron still has not asked me if i want a beer or if i was eating she went into the kitchen came back out and started talking to the waitress on the other side of the cash register where now i can't even see her i counted off a full minute she never came over so i got up and walked out after about eight minutes they can kiss my ass i guess you have to be in the click damn ridiculous and i tip well all i want is some damn simple service you should always acknowledge a customer when they walk in terrible bartender 
came in here for the famous pimm's cup which was refreshing but i didn't think worth the almost 15 price tag nice bar but understaffed the night we went took forever to flag down a bartender 
3 75 good overall food beer service menu farmhouse burger 4 very good deviled eggs 3 75 good beer selection 3 75 good hope they add victory winter cheers draft samuel smith's nut brown ale bottle water tap 3 5 good french fries 3 25 pretty good
the cab came pretty quickly after i called and the driver was nice enough to wait for me as i dropped my son off at a party and then took me home very pleasant 
very cool shop my sister and i stumbled upon it after going to tavolo v and piccione pastry piccione is almost right next door my sister is a candy addict so we stopped in there are tonsss of types of candy they sell here including seasonal items specialty items hard to find in other places and lots of candy related merchandise some of the things i saw were shirts dog toys body lotion onesies for babies purses bags and more - all with candy motif they have lots of packages candies and also lots of other types that they weigh and you pay by the pound i bought some christmas candy on 50 discount after the fact and a bag of lemon honey organic candies - great for winter colds and sore throats and just tasty stop by if you're in the area or looking for a unique candy shop experience get some fruit slices or candy cigs you'll enjoy them 
i absolutely loved my experience at painting with a twist i went with friends which makes a first-time experience easier but had so much fun i'd be perfectly willing to go on my own some time the step-by-step instructions were a breeze to follow and i ended up with a painting that i never would have thought i could produce huge kudos to the presenter for her clear explanations and her friendliness i'm not a huge fan of the little games mid-session but they kept it light and fun and i had no complaints the cost is average for the experience and i've already signed up for another session 
is it possible to have break-up sex with a restaurant maybe it'd be break-up eating whatever anyway last thursday we were heading home to new mexico from phoenix and were going to meet a friend at the el charro's on broadway it was my favorite place to eat while traveling with my wife and dog as we could eat on the patio which was nicely shaded but it was not to be there's now a big stupid cvs pharmacy on the corner and it is no more so we dug in to yelp and google maps and some site called findfido iirc to find restaurants nearby that were dog-friendly and we found la salsa we called they said they had outdoor seating and allowed dogs so off we went and it was pretty good it wasn't el charro good but it was several steps up from taco bell on their menu diversity and quality my wife had the tacos el pastor a standard for her i had a taquito quesadilla platter both were quite good we really liked their salsa bar but i found the quesadilla a little lame still all in all a pretty good meal just not what i wanted or was expecting not a bad consolation prize had i thought a bit and not been emotionally traumatized by losing the el charro location i would have plugged their name in to google maps and found the location a block from where we were when we began our search unfortunately the findfido site doesn't do mapping very well and it was kind of hard to find specific locations 
i'm originally from asia so i do know my food this restaurant actually surprised me the good way from the very courteous and helpful reception i think her name was michelle to the other staff to the food all excellent the mee goreng ala indonesian style is really good the portion is rather small but you can expect that from such an establishment they serve you quality not quantity tucked away in a downtown street this gem is the place to go if you're visiting santa barbara 
i had nothing but a great experience i made an appointment several weeks in advance as i was only able to have a saturday appointment i went ahead and reserved my wedding date immediately they only do two weekends per weekend my flower appointment lasted nearly two hours but i walked away totally satisfied i brought in a pinterest board full of ideas which really helped to convey what i wanted i had a small wedding party but a lot of roses so my flower bill ended up being about 550 1 bridal bouquet 1 bridesmaid bouquet 6 flower girl bouquets 5 boutonnieres 3 wrist corsages the most fun as when the florists picked out real flowers and we ended up making up mock bouquets it was so helpful to have a mock bouquet instead of just a vision we also talked about ribbon and how it would be applied to the flowers we picked up the flowers the morning of the wedding at the des peres dierbergs you can choose which location would be best in order to save 50 and to have the flowers for our first look there was plenty of water in each of the vases also my florist marked each flower piece with the individual's name so there was no confusion-very helpful i ended up with gorgeous flowers and was incredibly happy with all my flowers after the wedding i recycled the cardboard boxes and vases to my local dierbergs i couldn't have been more satisfied with my order 
here's my one sentence review rook is a little overpriced and i walked out still hungry here's my detailed review i dont mind blowing 30 on dinner or more thats fine but the food better a be fantastic and b be in enough portion to fill me up i think rook has issues with the latter here's how it works you order ala carte plates which have one item on them that ranges in price from 10 - 15 i got two plates the steamed bun slider thingy and some kind of fish both tasted fine but my bill with 20 gratuity cleared 33 that was too much considering i only had water to drink cocktails are double digits i was still hungry when i left i stopped at a taco stand on the way home to fill the void sorry rook i dig the vibe of your restaurant and your staff is top notch but i cant give a great review to any dinner establishment that leaves me hungry 
don't care if the food is expensive and i certainly do not care about long lines delicious delicious delicious i always go with the carne asada burrito loaded with flavorful meat and tasty toppings the guac is so chunky and good servings are huge p s - best drunk food ever 
we have visited 3 times so far and will return we were and still are golden flower fans but frankly i think we are leaning towards liking pho kietke better the sizes of the soups are not as big but if you know pho a lot of the difference is just the amount of broth here at pho kietzke i found the broth better i have had war wonton and wonton with fried wontons and veggie pho and spring rolls and the spring rolls were very good the service was very good the dining area clean and cool highly recommended 
my husband writes this might be my perfect restaurant the ambiance is old europe not trendy -- your grandmother would love it too such a break from the fancy tasteless food elsewhere in santa barbara service was very quick and knowledgeable they even gave a taste of the wine i was unsure about the service was great we had the salmon and the duck both daily specials the salmon was good a standard preparation but they did it pretty well but the duck was ridiculously overcooked like duck jerky and the sweet-and-sour cabbage tasted like it had been cooked with candy syrup -- ridiculous however we add points back on because after we complained about the duck they gave us a free chocolate roll this thing was insanely delicious -- basically rich chocolate mousse rolled up in marzipan pastry and big enough that together we still couldn't finish it so -- desserts and decor highly recommended food ok but nothing to write home about 
taro pudding milk tea was delicious the gentleman at the register helped me make a decision by giving me a sample my drink was ready in less than 2 minutes definitely recommended and will come again 
it needs to improve the service this was my second visit to this place and had to pay for extra sauce for an order of gyozas wait extra 25 minutes for a pick up order to end up not having the complete order gyozas were not included in the order 
the cleaning of our living room and stairway carpets did not get off to a good start they were supposed to arrive between 10 12 after we moved all of the furniture out of the rooms took the dogs to get groomed and had plans for the kids to be out of the house in the morning we got a call stating they would not be there until 1 00 messed up our plans for the day but our carpets needed to be cleaned the owner eric showed up and pointed out the dark area of the carpet which we thought was dirt but he said was wear after the cleaning the area still looked dirty but the owner insisted that it was dark because it was worn not dirt we took a clean paper towel to the area after eric left and it went from white to brown with a few wipes of the worn area we then brought out the towels to scrub a little deeper and quickly went through 15 towels getting the area much cleaner all we used was the wetness of the chemicals that eric originally cleaned the carpet no additional products on our end being really disappointed with the results of eric's cleaning i took pictures and texted him the images of the dirty towels asking him to call me back i did receive a call back i was debating whether to write this yelp review before the call the conversation definitely made my mind up for me he mentioned that the amazon local voucher that we used was for a surface cleaning only at no time during his arrival and setup was this mentioned and certainly not when we were talking about the dirty area he called worn on our call he mentioned that any additional deep cleaning would be an extra cost all eric had to say was that if we want the worn area clean he could do a deep clean and it would cost x dollars so he decided to lie to us and call the area worn verses doing the right thing most people do not like to be up-sold but where it is a legitimate need most people will see the value we were never given that option when i mentioned that to him he told me that he was tired of being told no the to deep cleaning that he stopped asking this is the owner of the business who has the most to gain from getting people to purchase additional services from him having to deal with his lateness at least he called the lie on the carpet condition lack of desire to tell me options and zero customer service skills to make up for his lie i would not recommend this business to anyone he was extremely apathetic on the call we made the mistake of changing from our original carpet cleaners trying to save some bucks in the end we will pay more to get the job done right 3 12 13 yelp pulled the pictures of my experience because they are looking for pictures of the business not their work please private message me if you are interested in seeing pictures of the carpet dirt that i cleaned up after they left 
i have eaten here many times and always enjoyed the food today was different the food was old and badly prepared i had the drizzled eggs sardines piperina salad and the artichoke tapas the food must have been lying around for awhile that is how toxic it looked whoever was the chief today should definitely be eighty-sixth who with any conscience would have allowed this garbage to be served that is where the food should have been in the garbage not on the table 
i have been a long time nacho mamas fan the food is always fresh and delicious this place has the best guacamole in stl and the chips are perfect as well also try the chicken fajita tacos or the chicken enchilada the margaritas are exceptional as well to make it even better you can drive through and pick up this quality of food you are a complete amateur with zero credibility if you give this place anything below 4 stars 
i am not much of a bar-goer and don't visit inside the bar very often but i love the food and order to-go a few times a month the blackened wings are so delicious and my fianc loves the bacon cheeseburger great management 
first time here and the experience is amazing they had quality food for hotpot and everything tasted fresh better than other all you can eats you find in philly will be coming back for kbbq 
honestly since moving to stl i haven't been to many chain restaurants but cheesecake factory is one of my most favorite places to visit the food is always delightful but of course the menu is is almost always overwhelming to look at too many pages with too many decisions to make this past visit i went with apps and dessert on my mind i don't think i have ever had a complaint with the food now this particular cheesecake factory must be on my do not visit again list only because i almost slipped and fell on my ass the floor is so slippery and the heels i was wearing that night did not have much of a grip i am thankful i was able to grab the wall to keep balance why must the floor be so slippery i get that it is marble but really maybe they should have signs or something to warn people i was a little upset about having to slide my feet while walking to and from the entrance not cool cheesecake factory-galleria mall-not cool food win atmosphere win marble floor fail
in my opinion this is the best jamaican food in the city the portions are big and the food is just full of flavor i use to go here everyday when i went to ccp it was definitely the best part of my school days the jerk chicken is good but the ox tail is just mouth watering the meat is cook until it's so tender that it just falls off of the bone oh another thing i would like to add with each platter you get a choice of a side dish ex mac n cheese cabbage etc my favorite use to be the sweet corns but they stopped offering it many years ago definitely would be a big plus if they would add that back on the menu but my second choice is always the side dish of steamed cabbage i highly recommend this place to everyone who loves flavor and caribbean food 
okay i admit it i just wanted the double schmitter which is why i stopped in that sandwich is just so darn good that it's worth the imminent heart attack extra steak cheese sauce onions salami and tomato slices on a fresh conshy roll the sauce is the best part although it is the only caveat is the somewhat limited beer selection but the ambiance is very friendly and relaxed they also had clam chowder tonight but it tasted bland stick with the schmitter or tobias also has pepperoni for a spicy kick 
not sure i'd recommend the sunday brunch which is lots of heavy german and southern food picture fried chicken which was pretty darn good green beans corn mac cheese rolls with honey butter cinnamon spiced apples cole slaw pickled veggies ham and roast beef in never ending quantities on your table what i do recommend is the tour it's 5 and the historian has memorized 15 000 pages of lemp history with 9 000 pages to go she'll take as long as you want and you'll never exhaust her knowledge of the family history 
i really enjoy being cut off in the drive through line every single time i go here no really it's an awesome set up they have go check it out you'll get to wait ten minutes behind other cars and then have the joy of some jerk coming in the side entrence and straight into the drive through line ahead of you yea mcdonalds yea fat people 
pulled up here in the pouring rain and the bouncers said they were at capacity despite there being plenty of room inside offered us the chance to stand in line in the pouring rain or leave great hospitality
terrible service ordered a pizza on monday was told 45 minutes which was acceptable they tried to tack 5 on for delivery when i questioned that they took 2 off i was ok with that also so i patiently waited an hour and 15 or more minutes i called back i was told that my order was misplaced and they would start it now i asked about a discount for having to wait well over 2 hours the lady said there would be a discount but she didn't know how much i said okay the delivery driver brought the pizza and said that will be 24 95 i said no i am not paying that i was told it would be 22 95 plus an additional discount he said no discount i said take it with you i am not paying that much he took the pizza and left i called the store and after a talk with maybe the manager he said the driver will bring the pizza back and it's free i said okay thanks still hoping to have a good slice of pie nope it was by far one of the worst pizzas i have ever had don't waste your time or money 
located within the reading terminal market this patisserie offers a wide selection of baked good including but not limited to a unique array of cupcakes the flyin' hawaiian i think that's what it was named was an interesting mix of pineapple coconut and macadamia nut in theory this would've made a dynamite cupcake flavor but the overwhelming macadamia nut flavor overpowered what little pineapple and coconut i can taste the blueberry cupcake had an amazingly powerful blueberry buttercream frosting flavor that was able to stand up to the chocolate cake overall the quality of the cake and frosting in the cupcakes were top notch moist yet light cake and the perfect blend of sweet and creamy european buttercream frosting i'll definitely hit this place up again 
the pharmacy inside the damonte ranch walmart provides the absolute worst service i have ever received i truly believe that they have hindered my recovery from an open appendectomy for a ruptured appendix i was in the hospital for three days following my emergency appendectomy my attending physician was aware that i am a gastric sleeve patient and cannot digest antibiotics in pill form that is why he specifically wrote my prescription for a suspension liquid antibiotic when my mother went to have the prescription filled the idiot pharmacist flat out refused to fill the prescription as written by my doctor she told my mother that it would interact negatively with my other prescriptions the only other prescriptions that i had was for a liquid pain medication the person persisted and gave me my antibiotic in pill form the pill was gigantic i had to take it cut in half but even so my sleeve wouldn't digest it so i ended up throwing up several times this hurt very badly as the retching pulled at the 4 inch incision site every time i threw up it also made eating nearly impossible for 48 hours because my stomach was so irritated to top it off i didn't have the antibiotic that i needed to fend off infection for almost a full 48 hours when the moron finally filled my prescription in suspension form like she should have the first time on thursday i called my doctor to refill my liquid pain medication he called in that same day to walmart when i called to check the status of the prescription the guy on the phone told me it hadn't been called in yet i called the next day and a woman told me i couldn't have a refill on this prescription for two weeks i had to go without pain medication all weekend just to call my doctor and discover that it was walmart who screwed up once again to top it off i had no one here to pick up my medication so i had to drive myself to pick up the prescription and wait in their monstrous line in extreme unmedicated pain when the lady ringing me up tried to make small talk all i could do was vent my frustration at her while fighting back tears of pain and utter frustration i wouldn't recommend this pharmacy to my worst enemy 
this is a great barber shop all barbers do a great job of hair cutting and all are very friendly if you are tired of these chain shops giving a mediocre cut with differing shades of greatness do what i did and come to bobs for a consistent great cut
this used to be my favorite mediterranean restaurant i think the food is pretty good however the chef is rude and i ordered on yelp and according to yelp prices my bill should've been 60 when i got there to pick it up they handed me a bill for 97 they said they don't advertise on yelp and never did and yelps prices are not theirs i looked it up on google and yelp says that their pricing was updated one month ago along with the other advertising for there magazine st restaurant i spoke to the owner and he tells me he is refunding my money and when i sent him a copy of the information on google for yelp he still insists that they do not advertise on yelp and have nothing to do with it he asked me to stop bothering him i thought i was doing him a favor by letting him know i guess he wasn't interested 
do you enjoy eating in an older bungalow in downtown meridian do you enjoy friendly and knowledgable servers do you crave croquetas then get to epi's i had the pleasure of checking out this local institution with some friends for the holidays our server informed us they are booked through the new year and i understand why there are plenty of smiles and plenty of shared plates to go around the table at epi's we shared a giant bottle of eguren wine it was a smooth delightful basque wine ham croquetas were best i've ever had and the calamari was tender not a bit rubbery if they have the mushroom soup on offer get it firm mushrooms with a zippy white pepper finish delicious my husband and i shared the grilled chicken and the special sole wrapped in shrimp and baked in a lemon butter sauce the chicken was tasty but not too memorable the fish was delectable would order again such a pleasant experience i'll be headed back to epi's for another special occasion very soon it's a pricier restaurant so not fit for most people on just an average day but well worth the price for a unique experience 
the service was friendly and fast thanks morgan the food was abundant for the price and very tasty 
wish i could have given more stars the only reason they got three was because the food was tasty the portions were good and the homemade sauces were pretty good the regular salsa was right out of a jar pace picante the poor girl working the floor had only been working for 4 days and didn't know the basics of table-service never got any silverware no check back on my my drink and she just wasn't up to speed yet probably come back and try them again later 
the atmosphere is really authentic i like that it wasn't covered in beer memorabelia like most mexican style restaurants are i think the pricing is a bit high compared to other restaurants of the same style when we went it wasn't a meal time so there were few patrons when the next customers came in with an entire nearly empty restaurant they stuck them at the table directly next to us salsa is really good but i wasn't exactly wowed by the food 
i've been wanting to try kappy's since a friend of mine told me about the all-you-can eat fish fry on friday nights i read a couple of reviews here that have been spot on here's my take being a friday night it was quite busy but the hostess was friendly and really hustling to get people seated i don't think we waited more than 10 or 15 minutes which isn't bad the decor is unique with a friendly vibe the booths definitely need to be updated but i really liked the atmosphere everyone in my party ordered the fish fry and then the wait began 45 minutes later we had our food now unless you have to catch the fish clean it fry it and then serve it it shouldn't take this long to serve this kind of food perhaps the kitchen is tiny - i just can't imagine why it took so long the table behind us actually got tired of waiting and got up and left as for the taste i wouldn't order it again the fish was hot but flavorless from the batter to the fish itself it was also quite greasy the fries were so-so i'm not a fan of coleslaw so i can't comment on that but i did like the flavor of the garlic toast so ultimately i'm giving kappy's three stars based on the atmosphere and the friendly staff i'm willing to go back to try something else on the menu based on the aforementioned things but i won't be ordering the fish 
had lunch at mass ave pub today we have eaten here many times during corona time we sat outside they have a beautiful patio setup with umbrellas and plenty of space between tables more than 6 feet we got the roast beef sandwich but on a hoagie bun we also asked for american cheese versus swiss sandwich came out hot and delicious plenty of meat peppers and mushrooms were fresh and elevated the delicious meat hoagie was perfectly crispy tater tots were hot and crispy service was phenomenal we had the same bartender we always get we love the staff christy and amy always give you personalized service and give you their time we love how friendly they are and they aren't afraid to share a laugh with you we never are let down we also got side salads to start with ranch their side salads we warn aren't small packed with fresh vegetables can't go wrong if you want a taste of something local with a huge diverse menu check this place out you won't be upset we also appreciate the hand sanitizer on the tables from a local distillery thank you mass ave pub for supporting local businesses 
i have been coming to this celebrity tanning location for months and it's always a lovely experience the tanning beds i've used here are adequate to phenomenal i always get a quality tan madison assisted my sign up for a membership after i attend weekend promotion she was kind and knowledgeable my encounters with other staff members has been wonderful as well based on my experience celebrity tanning has great custom service and great tanning beds 
awesome service and great food it was my families first time trying marcos and we definitely don't regret it we ordered pizza wings salad and cinnamon bread online and had it delivered it arrived quickly and katiuska was our driver she was very polite and friendly our food was hot and delicious when arrived and everything was neatly packaged we will definitely be ordering again from marcos well done great service
i'm so happy i found this awesome place if you are looking for 5 star dinning don't go here if you want chilled laidback and vacation vibe then i highly recommend it i ordered the blackened grouper tacos- they were good and completed the experience the staff were friendly talkative and attentive dogs are allowed on tuesday area also includes a small beach paddle boards kayak rentals and hammocks live music on the weekends 
i really love this cute little dessert shop located in dogtown in walking distance to some of the great bars and little boutiques in the area the ice cream was rich creamy and exactly what you would want to cool off on a hot summer day or even warm spring fall indoor seating available if you want to hang out while you eat your ice cream but also located in the perfect spot to take your ice cream and walk around to explore the owner is amazingly friendly and was able to hold a great conversation with us both while she served our ice cream and as we ate however it wasn't the overbearing type of conversation where she was forcing it and we didnt want it it was incredibly pleasant and you could tell that if we didnt want to have the conversation she would stop parking can be a little challenging because of where its located but we were able to find a spot a few blocks down on a relatively busy day with little ease 
this spot is awesome the staff are friendly informative and knowledgable about their tasty menu items they have space for meetings and a pool table in a room for groups who would like to reserve the space love this cove xoxo
we get takeout about twice a month from don cuervo and it never disappoints the food is always hot and ready when i get there and there is a lot - always enough for lunch the next day 
i'm not the type to write reviews but i can't help this one first instance i scheduled for a ups pick up in downtown edmonton they ask you a specific time for pick up so i wrote down 2pm the ups guy cam in 20 minutes earlier and when i tried to ask him to wait for me for 5 mins while i wrap up my items he said that he can't wait and left this guy was awful he was not courteous at all in fact he was so rude i complained to their customer service and asked if i could get the name of the guy to file a complaint they replied that they don't know who it was are you kidding me seriously i gave them my invoice number and they didn't know who picked it up second terrible experience most probably from the same guy since he handles the downtown area i ordered a high chair from costco after a few days i was wondering where my package was and it just stated on their notification that it was left at the front door front door of the lobby or my apartment which one thankfully costco was on to it right away companies and people should not use their service they are ruining their brand and losing customers big time if you want to courier something use fedex 
food was good had the eggplant sticks and red beans the food came in great portions and the chocolate mousse cake with ice cream was outstanding 
had a solid meal here with great service we loved the ecclectic menu and there were lots of good things to choose from at prices that certainly didn't break the bank had the hangar steak which was cooked to perfection and of course the french onion soup the waiter was obsessed with filling our water glasses which was well meaning but every time i took a sip of water my glass was filled to the brim again i am looking forward to going back and trying more things on the menu 
so i've lined up 3 times since this place has opened first time it was an afternoon of a weekday going home after an appointment and after a half hour i hadn't even gained a spot gave up and went else where for s milkshake thought it was because of the entrance access backing things up way past two lights and decided to wait until the calgary trail entrance opened second time i went calgary trail entrance was now the only one open it was again the afternoon of a weekday but line up was only in parking lot it took less than a half hour to get through happy customer reaching the food destination and got that tasty milkshake that i wanted third time i seriously thought about ditching the line about 5 times a couple of those times being right in the parking lot line from pulling up on friday evening and starting in the line on calgary trail past the road that curves into it from the turn around area of gateway blvd i waited to order past 45 min and had my food and tasty milkshake in my hands after the hour mark that's intense now the food burgers here are ok if you order a regular cheese burger it's like having two patties both times i found this location puts a bit too much ketchup and mustard on the burger as when i unwrapped the burgers the bun and wrapper were covered thus no burger photo or you would have only seen ketchup still a good tasting beef burger meat wise and i like that i don't feel gross after eating it just very full onion rings are seriously road trip snack worthy and why i had originally fallen in love with peter's drive-in back in calgary many years ago they don't fall apart as soon as you touch them but the batter isn't crazy thick either truly an enjoyable onion ring now the milkshakes if you're like me summer means milkshakes for the road to enjoy on a summer night or heck just because you need cheering up i'm not a gulp it down kind of milkshake person i want to enjoy it over time extra awesome point here you can choose up to three flavours at the other locations it's so thick that i can enjoy it over an hour driving again that's why i've gone out of my way to peter's in calgary and made red deer my main pit stop now i have to say with the two experiences of reaching my food destination the second was more of what i expected to receive for their milkshake consistency i'm hoping the other week was because they were training people and maybe that's why the consistency was off as that first milkshake i was done by sherwood park that's not normal to finish their milkshakes in less than 20 min it was still good and i loved my flavour choice one can't go wrong with banana-blackberry but it left me wondering how such a small chain could be so different i decided i wanted to give this location a second chance before writing my review my milkshake yesterday was seriously the one i was expecting i selected blackberry-raspberry combo and not only had it for my drive but for the whole length of time i sat out in the park freezing while watching the birds on the lake and picnicking with my very late supper yes you read that right i drank a milkshake outside in crazy cold alberta wind i'm that kind of crazy canadian as it was close to closing time when i was driving away i noticed the security guard had moved from his position by the building door to the front entrance of the parking lot i can assume in the over half hour wait in the parking lot line that he had timed vehicle progress and realized he better stand out there to cut the line off i appreciated the fact that he waved to me when things were clear to merge out to calgary trail as unfortunately exit is going through the line up and you can't see other lanes when there's trucks back to back the parking lot itself is kept clean probably due to the fact no one was going inside so no chance of any littering staff at the windows super friendly order booth was again hard to hear this time because the two orders were taken at the same time there's two rows when you reach the order area and the other time due to construction work so i think in time they'll get better at dialling into the surrounding noise overall i would return here however if i see the line up is past the parking lot i will confine on gas might still be cheaper than it was last summer but i can get milkshakes else where that are also decent in less time other locations 
my friend found this place and we thought hey let's give it a shot my friend ordered the veggie burrito and loved it it was huge so she got a lot of bang for her buck - plus it came with a side of chips and salsa wasn't huge a fan of the salsa since there was some pineapple in it but that's just due to my likes dislikes i ordered the island fruit salad with coconut ice cream pictured omg fresh fruit paired with fresh sorbet after a day at the beach yes please it also was displayed beautifully something i appreciate not only was the food great but the cashier was very kind and helpful overall great experience and i recommend this to anyone who goes to clearwater love supporting local places this was a gem 
the four seasons philly is sadly about to close down in order to build a brand new building instead of renovations i just hope they bring back the same workers because they are phenomenal everyone treated me and my partner like we were their royal friends d even though we were here on a discount lol this might be one of my favorite locations out of majority of the four seasons i'll be sad when it's gone 
excellent food great friendly staff just plain good im probably a little biased im there everyday 
great dining experience perfect for date night drinks and food are always amazing will definitely be returning
upon our arrival i had mixed feelings about this place and was pleasantly surprised we ordered the sampler as an appetizer the redneck egg rolls pork cheese and coleslaw were amazing i am not a fan of pork either the sampler also came with wings in a chipotle- grapefruit sauce that was also good but tasted heavily of apple cider vinegar for a main course i had the bbq brisket sandwich and it was phenomenal my husband ordered the brisket cheesesteak with cornbread i requested a bite of this and it was absolutely amazing literally just great the cornbread was also fantastic we can't wait to come back 
worst place ever decided to come here after watching under cover boss at checkers i did the walk up window but was ignored there were workers inside standing around doing nothing but no acknowledgement at all as i stood there deciding on whether to leave or not i suddenly realized there was a guy standing behind me mumbling something about selling me an ipad i turned around to see who was talking and found a guy with all gold teeth and face tattoos he then said he'd follow me to the atm so i can pay him 150 dollars for a 1 000 dollar ipad i told him all i wanted was a sandwich and since i still had not been asked to order i thought maybe it was time to go i guess you get what you ask for but thought i'd give it a try 
i came in a weary traveler and left a comotose puppy-bellied new local i just moved to town and literally have only been here a couple of hours i was starving and looking for the first of many spots to frequent since i will be living and working close by this was the fourth place i had gone to looking to eat but the first place willing to sit a single person so thanks i had the lobster deviled eggs and poke bowl each item was full of flavor and spice totally hit the spot and filled the void see you lots in the future 
we went to j j thai for dinner and the service was great we were seated within 20 minutes on a busy night without reservations and the main course was on our tables by the time we finished our apps we ordered the escargot and lamb chops for the appetizer and they were finished within the minute needless to say they tasted amazing for dinner we picked up the drunken noodles highly recommend over pad thai pan seared scallops recommend over the tuna and the green curry do not get the mixed vegetables very sub par for dessert we ordered a typical fried vanilla ice cream with cranberry sauce and after the first bite ordered 3 more definitely giving the restaurant five stars because of its service and food and coming back again d 
never again thanksgiving dinner was awful quality of food was not there even the turkey and gravy was just edible the menu sounds great so beware and don't believe it even a cheap chinese is a little better salads stuffing sweet potato's yuk crab cakes were good and that's it 
great new place that just opened up a couple of weeks ago in tampa it's in a plaza so be sure to keep an eye out for it the service was great and the people were super nice i ordered the shrimp cocktail it was seriously the best shrimp cocktail i've ever had there were 3 jumbo shrimp on the glass and many more jumbo shrimp inside the cocktail was sweeter than normal but so delicious i even saved a little to put on my carne asada the carne asada was a good size portion and came with beans and rice for dessert i had the tres leches and it was really good and served chilled which i think makes it even better 
shockingly high prices for pho menu lacks pho tai seems very odd no soy bean milk so i'm trying a banh mi pretty good reasonable at 6 
horrible service and this is not the first time placed delivery order for delivery at 12 00 pm still no delivery at 12 40 pm ordered catering a few weeks ago for lunch when the food was supposed to arrive they called and said they could not accommodate same day catering even though the site permitted it and it was already paid for don't waste your time especially during the work day i have learned my lesson 
loved the place crab boil was amazing and the wings cajun flavour was amazing as well will definitely return older bartender white guy was very friendly and helpful
if you're looking for a stylist look no further and book danielle as a person that has always gotten highlights i've had my ups and downs with some stylists either being too dull and sometimes brassy looking or too bleached out danielle got me my perfect blonde and i couldn't be happier she has so much experience in her field i would recommend her to anyone looking for something new or just keeping their regular style looking fresh and great 
i stopped by british delicious on a whim this weekend when i was in search of a nice place to relax and have some tea in dunedin besides going to the typical starbucks or other coffee place the restaurant is set in a traditional quaint building close to downtown dunedin it had a nice relaxing feel and i really enjoyed the british d cor there is seating available both indoors and outside on the patio the menu offers a few different sandwich items as well as some british specialty items the owner was also cooking some type of curry dish for the dinner menu when i came in but i wasn't going there for lunch more so just wanted a snack i tried the yorkshire tea and a croissant that was served with fresh strawberry jam delicious although i've never been a huge fan of british food i would probably return to give it a try and see how it is i would definitely go back again for more tea pastries and live music on the weekend they also serve a few different types of beer if you're in the mood overall i definitely like this place and found it to be another great charm of downtown dunedin 
service is friendly but slow food is ok but is over priced you see a lot of walking around but to get someone's attention to refill a water is a challenge my biggest pet peeve is when other servers don't help out with someone's table i asked for water from someone that wasn't my server that didn't seem to be doing anything and they said they would tell my server we sat next to the area with water pitchers i watched him go find my server and my server got to me a while later it would have been more efficient if he just refilled our waters he wasn't busy with any tables 
this place is a total scam do not fall for it i lost 100 dollars with their membership fees and being unable to make an appt every month this place in no way provided me any form of relaxation i gave it a chance too but even the therapists are hit or miss and usually its a miss good luck if you do business with them 
went back for a celebration lunch and it was really delightful we each had the classic burger which comes on a toasted and buttered sesame seed brioche bun with mayo lettuce tomato pickle and red onion i wanted well companion asked for medium and both were done to our specifications we split fries and a salad as our sides i had a perfect iced tea and my dining companion had a latte which he loved our server ciara was an absolute sweetheart and had just the right level of attention and focus to the dining service while giving us space we loved sitting outside on the patio and enjoyed both the meal and the setting a home run overall what i love about the cheesecake factory in reno is that it is real food that is well prepared with a focus on consistency value and timeliness 
this heavenly sanctuary is no frills but exactly what you need for that body of yours of all the massages i've ever had in my life i much rather spend my coins on tao and her partner who truly understand the body i had the 60min hot stone massage every kink and tension my body had was strategically massaged away i feel brand new and can't wait to go back 
rebecca is amazing her prices are very competitive and you actually get a full hour not 45 or 50 min like massage chains i went in with lower back and allergy problems she diffused eucalyptus vapors that cleared me right up the attention she gave my lower back was amazingly healing she cares about her clients comfort and their results i've referred several people who all have been extremely happy with her services booking an appt with her is so simple with the service she uses i highly recommend brandon massage oasis 
i was testing a new jeep wrangler loved the car the staff was great finance department easy to work with 
firstly there should be an option for no stars because this place demands it the only reason this place has 3 stars is because the owners have maliciously posted nearly all of the posts that's called cheating the quality of the food is poor the prices are outrageous and the drinks suck the service is not bad but still when i went in i ordered a ceviche with a pisco sour what i got was a plate with paper thin slices of white fish that had absolutely no flavor i was expecting thick chunks of fish the pisco sour seemed off i'm almost sure they're using bottom shelf vodka instead of pisco you can tell the whole thing cost me more than 30 and i was still hungry i will never go back 
they're back open i have been looking forward to the cld to re-open for 2 years and it's back same friendly owners similar menu with some great new items and the small hometown feel the owners make you feel welcomed like you're over their house for dinner and they have delicious food the only reason i'm giving 4 stars is because my first visit back our service was very bad she seemed annoyed that there were 5 of us and barely paid attention to us even rolled her eyes when asking for a straw also the sauce that was supposed to come with my meal wasn't on the plate and probably waited 20 min for her to come back to get it although service was bad i will still be back and hope for a different server 
hands down the best bbq in st louis do i need to continue it has a line usually wrapped around the corner but it is always worth the wait they will tell you they're known for the ribs but do not miss out on the burnt ends they are the best i've ever had and can usually be set with those alone when they tell you stl has good bbq this is what they were talking about 
love it here milkshakes to die for my son always asks to go here because if the play area we went last night around 9 45 after an unforeseen late dinner we were worried it was too late they close at 10 and things would be shut off or cleaned out early not the case the staff there was so friendly and the milkshake was amazing 
this is hands down the best in nola if your interested in voodoo or not you can not miss this display of new orleans history and culture 
bartender meagan was excellent immediately food was very good and the manager treated us like family will be going again and again 
as good of a music bar as you'll find in nashville or any other town lines can back up a bit at night and especially on the weekends so if you are here early grab your seats 
skip the line and get your beignets here they are not to be missed and had no line and right in the french quarter the other desserts here looked amazing as well but we only tried the beignets and i will never go anywhere else for one 
the best tacos i've found in or around indianapolis i first had them when they were a taco truck and followed them to their location on the building close by the old food truck stop they offer flour or corn tortillas and you have the option to mix and match if you'd like the steak tacos a la diabla are so flavorful that i drive the half an hour a few times a month and regret nothing they use to be much spicier but have tamed them quite a bit so everyone can enjoy i just add extra hot sauce now please try it out and share with friends i'd love them to stick around forever 
entertainment book that raises profits for schools etc they put out a coupon the specifically noted this location was a place it could be redeemed yet just because the employee wasn't allowed to scan it on the register - it is worthless one why do you put a coupon out that you don't honor two why don't your give your employees the ability to use a little bit of customer service and realize that something has gone wrong with the process overpriced as it is - and dishonest bad combo by the way the fellow at the counter was polite his hands were just tied 
imagine a korean pub sports tv kpop fried chicken beer lots of college kids the chicken is actually spicy if you go all out like we did like my mouth is burning it kind of hurts but it feels good spicy they don't have a lot of options besides chicken so if you're coming here commit to getting fried chicken the garlic one has a strong garlic taste that is good if you are ready for it if you are hoping for a mild flavor this is not the place the chicken itself is fairly crispy and not greasy so i will definitely plan to come again it just gets loud and crowded but it appeals to this demographic 
had book for 3 nights - briefly here is our experience first room -- 419 clothes closet door had 2 of 3 hinges broken off poor wifi reception 1 line only outlet above toilet hidden behind towel rack no overhead light or master switch to turn on lights to room switch by door only for vestibule foyer bathroom light on sensor and stays one for a few minutes after you leave bathroom so if you use it at night it will wake others in room glass paneled door lets light shine thru to sleeping area also bathroom has only a very small vent at about 2ft from floor between toilet and tub so room mirror will fog up when taking a shower also minimal counter space - very small room changed rooms within 10 minutes 2nd room -- 421 all the same comments for this room except no closet problem see above wifi strength was 2 lines - good but slow switches to table lamps tied so tight to bedside table that can barely use switch no minifridge with out special request was quickly supplied when asked for while parking was ample 2 levels underground the 1st level is fine and serviced by an elevator the lower level was partially flooded because of rain entrance to ramp to lower parking level partially 'hidden' due to very poor signage and inadequate lighting at an obtuse turn low level lighting in lower level with no elevator services have to walk up secluded staircase in poor condition broken stair treads walls have peeling paint water seepage etc to upper parking level and then walk across level to other side of the upper level to get elevator no security cameras what-so-ever in parking area or stairwell went to hotel bar fox hound again inasmuch as hotel has only been open for 5 years after being closed for multiple years for renovation surprised that furniture is so well worn and very soiled service was fine complimentary breakfast was also a failure showed up about 1 2 hour before closing there were no clean knives only 2 bagels and 3 pieces of bread one portion of eggs remained - yogurt juice in ample supply bagels were inedible eggs rubbery room towels that we used and put on floor to assure replacement were not replaced after 1st day taken away but not replaced trash bag was left on a suitcase tried to call housekeeping to get more towels but phone only partially operative - the button for direct dial to housekeeping was non-operational did not have time to run down to reception to get attended to the tp holder in the bathroom is barely hanging on the wall and roll kept falling on floor generally speaking while the staff was professional and courteous the general condition of the physical plant of the hotel is fair at best left the room tuesday at 9am for the day and left the sign on the doorknob to please make up the room came back at 3 15 pm and room is still not attended to inasmuch as this hotel is well located and in its earlier incarnation same name had a good reputation grew up in stl and had been there several times in its past incarnation for celebrations and advertised has having had extensive renovation we were looking for a superior visit most disappointing would not return if given a choice as a closing point we did comment to the front desk that the 10 day parking fee was not told to us founded it in a badly worn stack of papers in a folder on the room's desk they a stated they would remove the charge - again staff was fine- physical plant and thoroughness of cleanliness is in question 
we decided to go to gamlin for a special celebration dinner it's been quite a few months since we were last here we got the shrimp and grits as appetizer a side salad and the chicken fried chicken entree to share we used to really like the shrimp and grits unfortunately the price had gone up and the portion is smaller still tasted good but not worth the price tag the house side salad was passable the biggest disappointment was the chicken fried chicken entr e the chicken was similar to a very weakly seasoned chicken schnitzel the mashed potato was completely bland strewn over the top of that were shaved brussel sprouts that were barely blanched and still bitter the worse thing about the dish was the thick glop of absolutely tasteless white mush passing as gravy on the chicken there is overpriced food that can still taste good but this was grossly overpriced bad food i know cwe can be expensive but this is outrageous 
wow if you love mediterranean food that you can get quick this is the place to go there also great for catering 
looking for a good burger in the reno sparks area i stopped at burgerim in the outlets at legends the service was very good and polite nice selection of burgers and chicken sandwiches including a salmon burger and a falafel burger i chose the duo to try their angus beef burger and the greek lamb burger the angus burger was good and came with american cheese lettuce tomato pickles and onion along with their house sauce blemd of mustard ketchup mayo the angus burger was good nothing outstanding the house sauce needed something like pickle relish as it was bland the greek lamb burger came with greens onion tomato and tzatziki sauce the sauce was a good touch and made the lamb flavor come out i ordered half onion rings and half fries the onion rings were thick cut onion and had a crispy breading very tasty skip the fries they were potato rounds that were neither crispy like a chip or soft like a french fry the were chewy and couldn't be helped with ketchup i would opt for the sweet potato fries instead next time i may try their dry aged beef burger the falafel burger or maybe the wagyu burger 
purchased a rental car off orbitz when i arrived they did not have the type of car available said they only had suvs left was told i needed to pay 40 extra a day this is the definition of bait and switch rent from someone else 
in from out of town with my fianc decided to stop in for some dinner love p f chang's back home always perfect this location is far from perfect the hostess was flustered with 2 couples came into be seated she gave us an eye roll when we asked for a table the restaurant wasn't even busy with 6 tables in the entire restaurant finally after almost 10 min she got us a table upon sitting down i realized that there was over 5 tables that had dirty dishes on them literally looked like a bomb went off as the server took our drink order they switched servers mid service as we ate our cold entree the tables never got cleared owning multiple restaurants in florida i hate to leave reviews but i can't believe this unbelievable for the caliber of restaurant management wasn't present i really hope corporate looks into this matter because this is mind blowing how do you expect someone to enjoy there meal while being surrounded by dirty dishes 
i took my yorkie there on a sunday as he was vomiting during the night has a heath issue that my vet has been addressing the front desk was efficient very helpful although they were quite busy we saw dr sherman within 15 minutes after doing bloodwork she made several recommendations to do that day which was expense as they are an emergency office the dr took the time to speak with my vet by phone to discuss what would be best to do then what could wait until monday at my vet's office this was extremely helpful the service was wonderful i highly recommend this office their fees are high but worth taking your sick pet there for emergency service 
the woman who owns this business is incredibly unprofessional they advertise that clean uggs i brought 2 pairs of uggs in 4 days ago the owner said she didn't know if they cleaned them so i assumed she was an employee she says she has to call the guy who i assume is the owner she leaves him a voicemail i leave my boots with her and she says she will call me after 4 days i'm wondering why i haven't heard anything so i happened to be near there so i figured i'd stop in and check the status first it took 10 minutes for her to come out from the back of the store when she finally appears i asked why i haven't heard anything she starts waving her hands around screaming he hasn't called her back saying he drives everywhere california new york florida etc he can't have time to call me back i say why are you giving such an attitude she replies with i'm a business owner i don't need someone coming in here asking me questions that i don't have answers to i'm too busy running my business i respond with then i guess you don't need my business she says guess not she grabbed my boots from the back and actually threw them from across the room to the front of the store where i was standing i'm in complete awe i still cannot believe that happened it would be my advisement to take your dry cleaning business elsewhere if she can't respect her customers than she shouldn't have any 
authentic ny style pizza the quality ingredients make for the best pie in northern nevada the homemade sausage is exceptional the owners are so friendly and they are providing a great opportunity for special needs adults in reno a must visit for any pizza lover in the area 
have been here after hours for a drag show which was amazing our bartender was named katie she was beyond the best and very sweet food was also good
this was honestly one of the best restaurants we have been to in a while a group of 4 of us ended up here by mistake this past weekend after not being able to get into mercato across the street we grabbed some drinks at the bar and hung out for half an hour while we waited for our table the sangria was delicious and they had a fair amount of interesting beer for the men in the group we ended up ordering the butternut squash flatbread awesome figs in a blanket pork belly sliders lamb lollipops the medi-latin sampler plate and a trio of desserts everything was fabulous but we definitely recommend the flatbread and the sampler plate we will definitely be returning next time we are back in philly 
i love the ambiance of ciros the food is average some things better than others the lamb lacks flavor but we love the duck fries and burgers are good too chicken and waffles just ok the drinks are fabulous not only do they have unique names but are taste great and pack a punch i would recommend for drinks and maybe an appetizer but not for a meal make sure you call ahead for the password it's all part of the fun of the atmosphere 
i just had the opportunity to stay at radisson valley forge i had no trouble getting there it is off the turnpike and is very conveniently located a relative that attempted to visit me there was challenged to find it with a droid gps and a garmin gps anyway parking is in a spacious lot and although some construction in the lot made things a bit challenging i was able to park right next to the door could not have secured a spot any closer what luck the lobby is average and attractive check in was easy and friendly despite the jerk who cut in to complain that his a c unit in his second room was not cooling to 65 fast enough i checked in quickly and efficiently i could tell the hotel has been there for a while if i could not any other way by the elevators they were a little rough around the edges but clean my room was spacious had a nice sleep number king size bed it too was older and you could tell it had been used hard but cleanliness was average to above average internet was adequate the a c had been retrofitted and were still the wall units with a thermostat they were adequate but a bit noisy just a note and not a complaint but just a statement of fact this is not a quiet hotel the elevator dings and the soda and ice machine are in the hallway the doors slam loudly if you do not prevent that from happening and the hospitality repair and cleaning staff have walkie talkies and are not quiet in their interactions despite these things i slept okay-ish the rooms could stand an update but it was very adequate food at the meeting was good and breakfast at one on the onsite restaurant was fine and service was good the meeting rooms were spacious and were properly temperature controlled and we were not packed in on top of one another they do have several cheesy 'fantasy suites' several of my friends at the meeting had the pleasure of these rooms they looked like they were done in the early 80's and were really cheesy with no windows and mirrors bow chicka wow wow one person remarked they looked like the set of a bad 80's porno and i suspect she may have been correct i think the attraction of this hotel is meeting space and location cost is average to below average for this type of hotel i spent 109 a night would i seek it out no but would i resist staying there again if a meeting was scheduled there no 
great spacious upscale restaurant with ample tv screens it was football season c'mon and plenty of parking i was impressed with the vegetarian-friendly choices throughout the menu and the emphasis on organic all-natural ingredients they also have an expansive cocktail beer menu bourbon smash - a twist on the good ol' moscow mule prasino green salad - huge portion tasty and surprisingly filling pappardelle - delicious lots of flavor and we loved the chorizo seitan since it was my husband's birthday they brought us their dessert of the day on the house which was some take on a blueberry muffin super sweet and good - but probably wouldn't have ordered it ourselves 
avoid this place- tourist trap went to this restaurant during mardi gras weekend the waitress seemed nice but ended up up-charging us for everything i ordered a side cup of gumbo and when it arrived she said maybe this isn't the right thing i asked if it was the 7 dollar side that i wanted and she said yes later when we received the bill it was a 14 dollar main dish there were two extra dishes added to our check as well when pointed out the waitress insisted it was a mistake both of my friend's orders were also upcharged for certain substitutions that she had initially assured us were of no extra charge this place is obviously trying to make money off of drunk tourists and the waitstaff is filled with scam-artists i am sure there are many more authentic restaurants but this was not worth the money or the aggravation 
customer service here is excellent as well as the service i have been coming here for over two years now and i highly recommend angels automotive when you need to get your car serviced right and the guaranteed security thanks guys
came here on a random friday night for drinks to our surprise glen davis andrews was playing we've seen him on frenchman street and on treme so we knew we were in for a treat the show was amazing we had several drinks i stuck with the cosmopolitan it was great service was just okay in the lounge for the best service sit at the bar 
the food is less than mediocre we ate here about 10 years ago thought the food was awful we never returned until this week since we just moved into the area i asked the waitress what is good she recommended the eggs benedict the eggs were over cooked the yolks hard the english muffin was burned on one side untoasted on the other was completely soggy the hollandaise sauce was just awful it tasted almost like margarine was used rather than butter or it came out of a can even the hash browns were soggy with a huge pile just slopped on the plate i don't get it if you are going to have a restaurant why on earth would you not serve great food i write this honest review in hopes that that the owner manager gets the message 
i love frankly sausages i have never been disappointed with my meal and the staff is great the menu is always growing and changing so i am excited at every visit glad they are open for lunch now too 
this is one of the best cocktail bars i have ever encountered between their strict regulation of the number of patrons and the subdued atmosphere the experience remains enjoyable even when the bar is busy second patrick is one of the most competent bartenders i have ever met if you like floral gin cocktails make sure you have him make you a precheck it may not be on the menu but it is a standout this take on a sour uses egg whites and floral notes to balance the usual acidity with great success finally the fried brie is an excellent small plate bacon jam wow the only drawback maybe the price tag but you clearly get what you pay for here 
this place is so much fun the drinks are so good and really strong the music is pretty good too if i am downtown with friends drinking we always have to make a stop here for some fun the bartenders are all really friendly and it's a pretty laid back crowd try the amf here it's really good
there is something to be said for a restaurant that doesn't shy away from seasonings the pistolett was well seasoned and melted in your mouth the shrimp in grits is really good we capped things off with the bread pudding which was extremely delicious this place is well worth a visit 
excellent was greeted by the owner his wife beautiful people wonderful food big portions fresh made to order smaller dinning area but no worries they will accommodate i am impressed how they tailored to my vegetarian diet i ate the cajun shrimp tacos and was blown away at how amazing they are i will definitely become a regular thanks donnie owner simply amazing 
it has been a few years since i left norristown the first tho g i did was visit amans in norristown and what a disappointment my fave chicken vindalu has too much vinegar and was watery and the jalfrezi has become a sweet sauce dish as much as i enjoyed my appetizer the entrees is a huge failure even the daal makhani was atrocious only later i found out this place is not big dave's anymore new owners have had this place last 2 years thank god i don't live here and do not need to eat here p s big dave has a place called amans bistro in phonixville n chalfont will visit next time i am around wish my mum had told me 
first as an illustrator i have to comment on the walls in this place it's a very cool hand penciled collage of lady faces with pops of color i dig it the signage is done in the same style i wish somebody would contract me out for something like that i picked this spot out because it's new it's latin and it's far enough away from the piazzerties walk i wasn't sure how cafe or un-cafe it was going to be chismosa turned out to be more traditional in the self seating sense it was very clean and i liked the overall decor including the little couch and vinyl listening station maybe in the back so what did i get let's give it up one time for the choripan it's a chorizo panini-style sandwich with some guacamole and onions and eh i forget but it was great it was messy and i'm not a messy eater in the slightest it's a good thing i was catching up with a friend and not dining alone otherwise i may have been consumed by slipperiness of this sandwich when i make these at home i slice my sausage julienne style i've never seen that in a restaurant cafe but i certainly wouldn't mind other than that it came with some chips and 3 sauces i went for the ghost chili sauce and as someone who is heartburn prone i slept good that night they know what they're doing here my friend had a salmon dish he was quite satisfied and the presentation was great from what i could see i suppose it was the owner who was running the show he's a friendly guy and most helpful he even invited us to try out his signature soft scones oh snaps kid if you've ever had the sandies cookies it's that consistency with a bit of chew to it they were great with us he shared a jalapeno and cheese and a cherry and bacon what bacon in a cookie i don't even like cherries but i tore it up it's a great idea we also had 2 freshly made mint limonadas with a couple shots of simple syrup it was right on the money aaah the money so this place is a little pricy but i expected that if i see value i'll pay for it and chismosa has it 
we were there for a wedding reception in the top level the appetizers were delicious and the sangria was the best the waitstaff was really friendly and tolerant of our loud group i will definitely go back next time i am in santa barbara 
stopped on our way through nashville and glad we did this place is awesome we were there on a sunday around 11 and there was no line the bbq is out of this world the upstairs is amazing i wished we had more time and nowhere to go we would have liked to stay here all day 
i've eaten a lot of banh mi and this is at the top of my list i had the grilled shrimp and grilled pork sandwiches it was so good i ordered a grilled shrimp to go also a plus the staff is very friendly and the service is fast i will make sure to come back on my next visit to new orleans 
these guys are a ripoff took my 2007 3 series for inspection the left fog lamps were popped out and they wanted 394 to replace it otherwise i would fail inspection i asked them not to do anything and took my car failed my inspection of course i then went to pepboys and got an 8mm socket for for 3 99 and fixed it myself all it needed was two screws never taking my car to these guys again 
great service they were able to accept my car half hour before my actual appointment and did a fantastic job very friendly and helpful employees definitely coming back next time my car needs service 
i visited bazbeaux's on my most recent trip home to visit the fam i had eaten there years ago and remembered it fondly maybe i had been over hyping this place in my head but i was disappointed - ordered the arugula salad the garlic bread and the mediterranean pizza the salad was good but kind of eh would have been nice if they'd tossed the salad first the garlic bread was ridiculous bread soaked like literally soaked all the way through with garlic butter and topped with cheese just too much the pizza wasn't bad but there just seemed to be too much going on and something seemed to be missing weird combo too much meat and cheese but missing some basic seasoning salt pepper garlic the pizza kind of reminded me of the amy's frozen pizza you get at whole foods the outside seating was nice and it's always fun to hang out in broad ripple despite that the food just wasn't that good so i'm not sure i'd give bazbeau's another shot 
very nice atmosphere on the main street with open windows overlooking the stream and beautiful weeping willow location location location tapas plates are good especially enjoyed the cheese plate did the red wine flights which i can't say i really enjoyed them when the waitress asked i said that the wines were not for my palate but i enjoyed visit she proceeded to educate me that the owner is an avid wine fan who puts together exceptional quality wines on his menu and is associated with wine spectator okay i still hope to return again and try their next group of wines 
this place had the best breakfast lunch early evening food and service in downtown nashville we had 10 in our group and most of us went back a few times 
randomly found this deli while trying to find a place to eat that was open at 8pm on a saturday i walked in and was overwhelmed by all the options i didn't know what po boy to order especially since i already had fried food for lunch the guy behind the counter and the other guy who i assume was his son were both super patient with me i asked what they recommended something not fried and they suggested the new orleans roast beef po boy after waiting a few minutes i received my sandwich and it was so big considering the price for it when i went to pay for it at the cashier the son threw in a crawfish pie on the house the crawfish pie looks like an empanada and was warm and super delicious i totally would come back to pay for another one the po boy was stuffed with lettuce tomatoes and roast beef and was very flavorful so good 
if you want a trendy place with good drinks and a good vibe this is definitely the place to go although the sushi was fresh it is way overpriced and definitely not the best sushi in philadelphia 
the best roast beef poboys around the staff is always friendly we look forward to enjoying more of their kitchen creations catfish bella is an awesome dish hint hint 
really good food crunchy crust casual place to hang out not very nice inside but thats not what theyre going for 
the classic place to eat in eagle good pizza great garlic bread good spaghetti always busy so arrive early when i get back to eagle i always try to drop by it's right on the main corner of eagle it has a very traditional feel to it and the food is much better than you think it will be when you walk in the door 
good pizza i stopped into angeli for lunch while walking around new orleans the restaurant has a very cool look i was hesitant because there were only two other people in there but i'm glad we decided to try it i ordered a pepperoni and portobello mushroom pizza it came out quick and was delicious if you are planning to visit the restaurant with friends prepare to pay on one check the back of the menu states no separate checks and no separate payments 
the good the churros were good fresh and warm light and not the slightest bit of extra oil i devoured them way too fast i'd go back just for these the restaurant was clean well decorated and painted i always appreciated thought put into how a place looks especially in an area that needs more places that care about appearance price for 4-5 churros smaller than a donut bigger than a mini-donut and 3 large portioned tacos was 8 50 the bad possibly the worst chicken tacos i've had in a long time the mild sauce was completely tasteless not even a tiny bit of heat the sauce on the chicken itself was either just really flavorless or just an overwhelming amount of grease oil from cooking i could see bits of something in the mix but i couldn't taste any seasoning the taco looked home-made but since all the oil sauce soaked it through i couldn't appreciate it what a shame you can't get tap water you have to buy bottled water i think this is generally ridiculous and a blatant money grab at the expense of doing the right thing ecologically and decent thing to do wise i would have paid for it if the option was given a quarter or something no reason for this and not pet friendly if you want to give your dog a little water while waiting for your order i have a friend who raves about this place maybe i just ordered something on the weaker side of the menu if i decided to go back again i'll re-review at a future date but it won't be for awhile 
fun friendly spot the people aren't snooty about wine and the wine isn't overpriced i found the white wines to be pretty acidic but the red wines--especially the syrah and zinfandel--were great not too strong acidic or sweet i bought a bottle of the syrah the 10 tasting for six wines is pretty great too 
this place is fantastic only have been for breakfast many times and it is consistently great small place so it gets a little crowded but the staff keep things moving along great portions and amazing prices staff is super friendly have had omelettes pancakes and french toast great find in port richey 
i actually enjoyed myself here weekday lunch not very busy favorite items were grilled chicken coconut chicken better chunks of meat than the standard chinese place and vegetable mai fun noodles everything was actually pretty good like when you get a win at a non-assuming chinese take-out place it's no han dynasty but i'd totally go back here the sushi was not my favorite but i ate it and i feel fine i actually feel great but stopped myself from over- eating the fruit was fresh though some things liked under-ripe if i wasn't going back to work i would have gotten thirds would go back fornthe things mentioned above and maybe tried the shrimp cocktail or crawfish 
other than one friendly bartender i can't recommend this place the drinks are expensive given the atmosphere and location also i heard the security guard berating multiple guests during one night did not seem like a welcome place or somewhere to be because the security couldn't control himself 
i was recommended to xiandu by a friend so i stopped by during lunch for their specials on the weekdays it did not disappoint i was seated immediately and the restaurant was bustling there's a bar area in the front and more seating on a platform at the back the back was completely filled so i was seated in the bar area the ambiance was the feeling of upscale with dimmer lighting at the back i decided to opt for the pad thai lunch special which comes with tom yum soup the soup arrived quickly it was very good filled with vegetables the broth was a little more sour than i was expecting but it had a fresh flavorful taste the pad thai was pretty spectacular though for a lunch special the pad thai was very large and completely filled me up the dish was large and slathered in a sweet thai sauce that was amazing it was a bit too sweet but it coated the noodles very well and the noodles were absolutely filling xiandu's lunch specials are an incredible deal and i would highly recommend if you're looking for a thai lunch or even a delicious dinner 
i had a terrible haircut today at this supercut i had longer than shoulder length hair and i decided to cut it short i googled a style a very common inverted bob style and saved in my ipad when my hair dresser greeted me and i showed her the type i want and put my ipad on her counter so she can just check as she cut she said that's easy cut i told her clearly i wanted exactly like the picture longer in the front and shorter on the back it's inverted when she's done and she said she felt satisfied with her work but it's completely different than the picture she cut my hair very short and all the way from the front to the back it totally ruined my day i have to wear my stupid cap to cover this silly haircut i feel pissed i won't go back to this place anymore never 
don't understand previous reviewer's impressions of depressing and sleazy none of these strip joints is a fern bar open and airy with chamber music wafting around but i find this place quite comfortable bartenders are accommodating i often order just a tonic on the rocks wide variety of shapes and sizes of the girls who are just pushy enough on their rounds after their sets with a hand on your thigh and a kiss on your cheek 20 lap dances are pretty tame but get a 30 dance and hand her 40 as you enter the vip room or 60 for a double and give her 70 up front and you'll get a great bump-n-grind even better the second time you pick her on a later visit place is much better than the very mechanical and unsmiling behavior in oasis show-n-tel or venus video down the street music too loud for conversation as always in these joints but bearable no cover until 7 00 pm i think 
saw that they had great reviews for seafood boil so headed over on a bus but alas they were out of crawfish for 2 more days so call before you go if you're interested in the crawfish their prices are very decent 7 99- 9 99 for a styrofoam full of food one main and two sides can't say it was delicious but more a home style cooking at reasonable prices it is more of a carryout joint though they have tables you order at the counter pay and go sit down bare bones decoration 
update got my truck tinted here they only use xpel tint now which is great the owner dave showed me all the tint films and was patient with my pickiness it turned out exactly how i wanted it 
i have always appreciated the vibrant tucson coffee scene long since i left town many years ago i think it continues to be one of the best in the country when returning to tucson for the first time in six years this december i was excited to see what new shops had opened and try more great java my husband perused the coffee shop listings articles and reviews and picked exo as our first stop--he was certain it was my kind of place boy was he right the cafe and roastery is located in a beautiful brick industrial space a few blocks from the 4th ave shopping district during our first visit on a sunday morning the roaster inside the shop was hard at work and the wonderful smell of roasting coffee was in the air my husband ordered a decaf americano my go to is always some variation of black coffee espresso iced cold brew iced americano a plain hot coffee or a plain hot americano i was intrigued by their mesquite cold brew which was sadly not in season so i asked about their chiltepin cold brew cold brew coffee brewed with chiltepin peppers mixed with truffle chocolate and topped with a dash of cream i substituted coconut milk and they offered almond and hemp milk also the barista highly recommended it despite my initial skepticism so i had to give it a try it did not disappoint hardly sweet at all with a delightfully spicy finish i can't think of the last time i liked doctored coffee drink that much my husband enjoyed his americano and they offered a vegan flax seed cookie which was also lovely despite only having a few days in the area and wanting to try all the new coffee places that have sprung up on our trip we had to come back here a second time because of the great experience although i did not get the opportunity to try anything from their bar area in back on this trip as an avid mezcal and tequila fan i look forward to exploring that part of their business also during our next tucson visit thank you exo 
absolutely amazing the owners were super accommodating and friendly the room was recently updated and absolutely gorgeous with all of the necessary accommodations quiet yet super close to the beach would definitely recommend and stay again
they don't do what you ask them to do if you ask them to trim and shave the ears they say ok when you pick your pet up it still looks the same and then they say oh the ears don't look good shave and trim but you still have to pay so why did i take him there for then 
ordered two steak burrito bowls on uber eats with chips and salsa neither bowl had any meat in it and we got chips in queso we didn't enjoy anything we received we won't be ordering from here again
i can spend hours in this store great staff ready to help in anyway they can they will put you on a list if you're looking for a book they don't have and have came through for me the prices are reasonable love their warehouse sales 
giving just three stars as will go back when they are officially in their new coffee shop space had not been here for over 20 years so was interested to see what it is like now kind of picked the wrong time as their coffee shop is being totally remodeled and so closed and you are directed for that same menu in their steakhouse area must say the staff were welcoming and clearly have tons of regulars that they dote on nice as many are elderly i has their veggie burger with fries and my husband had their pot roast my veggie burger was okay but must say the fries were delightful fortunately they did not give me tons as i would have devoured them all the pot roast was fine and we enjoyed our visit but will give a more accurate rating when we go back to experience the new improved coffee shop 
we were looking for a fun place with great food and a kid friendly atmosphere we hit the jackpot with puckett's all staff members were friendly and helpful the food was outstanding if you love mac n' cheese you've got to try the piggy mac it's pulled pork topped with mac n' cheese so good we had 2 adults and 2 kids in our party everyone truly enjoyed their meal the live music was also fun and entertaining we had an hour a half wait but they will take your number and you can do some site seeing or enjoy the various musicians in the area 
ok so i've been here 3 times in two weeks lol first time we had the chicken sandwich which was really great the taste was superb and i love he shredded lettuce with the tomato and white bbq sauce the only thing i would say is that i wish the patty was thinner and crispier or split in half and made like a double it was a little too bready in my opinion by itself while there we overheard the owner talking about bringing in the impossible burger which peaked my interest because i've been wanting to try it he reaped me in even more by telling me they do them in-n-out animal style as a special came back a second time and had the mustard in-n-out burger and the no animal fries it was really awesome maybe a tad too much mustard for me but very good the animal fries were my favorite part of that meal came back the next day and ordered regular fries extra crispy and a regular impossible burger with grilled onions cashew whiz and plain otherwise we also ordered the patty extra crispy that was amazing tasted more like a real burger and the fries were crazy good being a extra crispy they also stayed crispy longer we are meat eaters and this is hands down our new burger place keep up the great work 
excellent menu is confusing don't worry just let welday fix you up you will have lots of good stuff left over to take home each item has a distinctly different taste and texture but all work well together an adventure and a pleasure the giant salad is a meal alone we brought the whole thing home 
the burgers here are so good mine was perfectly cooked cooked to order the wife had the mild garlic wings and said the were to die for we will definitely be back for more of this deliciousness 
favorite brunch spot in tampa i would go here every weekend if i could i love the kale scramble and the fried egg toast their pancakes are always delicious then add on that you can order buddy brew lattes and coffee to your table and it's the perfect place the decor is beautiful and there's a shop with really unique finds to browse while you wait for a table i would recommend this place to anyone who lives in or visits tampa 
the pleasant desk staff are genuinely the only reason i gave them the extra star the room was full of old stains rust etc as you can see in the photos below toothbrushes were on back order all weekend face clothes weren't available in the room and there weren't many at the front desk when we asked for them the upstairs ice machine was gone and the downstairs machine was completely broken so there was no ice for our 2 day stay their free breakfast turned out to be an 8 per person breakfast the signal on the outdated tv went in and out i've genuinely never experienced such an awful hotel 
a fantastic brewery taproom that just opened in the broadmoor area beautiful interior of a converted historic movie theater 15 belgian style beers that are the absolute best that i have tasted outside of belgium comfortable and pet friendly this is a must try on any beer tour of new orleans or to just hang out with friends with some of the best brews in the city wait staff is attentive knowledgeable and professional 
very rude and unprofessional cussed on the phone when asking price will not recommend to anyone 
undoubtedly best ipas in nashville great taproom great hosptality and a growing menu of sours stouts and lagers 
this is the third dentist that i tried after moving to boise the first one told my husband and me both that we needed crowns that was six years ago no crowns they other had a dingy office and put a bunch of fillings in my son that i'm pretty sure were not required i was relieved when i found lowry dental dr ben is really smart really nice caring very well educated and just a great dentist he always picks the conservative path - he'll try whatever he can to address an issue without invasive procedures they hygienists are nice and are really careful not to hurt me i am like many people not happy about going to the dentist but i feel very comfortable there and am glad i found them it's kind of a long drive from my house but it's worth it 
called them out to fix my ac i was told the call out fee was 59 that sounded fair what they didn't tell me was the 32 truck surcharge fee and the minimum labor fee was 99 in the end the charge added up to 190 to fix a loose wire i felt like i had been overcharged and not told the entire story about the fees called the manager and he would not budge i will never use this business again as i feel they are less than honest with their disclosure of charges up front there must be better in the reno area and as a side note the service tech told me they had forgotten about my appointment after i called them to ask where he was they called him and pulled him from a job to show up late to my appointment 
this is the best little place to get a caf and some snacks the empanadas are the best i've ever had 
i really like banana pudding and am very picky i don't believe that i have ever had banana pudding better than this we were visiting from out of town and just lucked into finding this vendor if you like banana pudding don't pass up the opportunity to stop by btw we had the classic vanilla flavor and sampled the chocolate-vanilla mixture both were great 
a night-in turned into a night out for drinks and appetizers for drinks i tasted the tucson and moscow mules the moscow mule is exactly what i expected not too strong and not too weak just right it had the perfect balance of vodka and lime juice however i was disappointed with the moscow mule the spice tasted like straight up cayenne pepper instead of habanero i would prefer a jalapeno pepper it also left a terrible after taste even after taking a sip of the tucson mule i brought this to the attention of the waitress and to my delight she compensated the drink with another tucson mule that was the highlight of the service because the remaining service was inattentive i had to prompt a waiter from another table for service the highlight of the night was the chessboard it had generous amounts of cambozola en croute goat and cheddar cheese bread nuts and fruits not only was it delicious but it was presented nicely on a farmhouse style cheese board it makes a great appetizer for sharing up to 3 or 4 people 
this was delicious and juicy hot chicken our kids had the chicken strips with tater tots and the po' boy sandwich my husband and i shared a whole chicken everything was delicious- especially the cheesy mac and cheese i highly recommend this restaurant our waiter nick was friendly 
the chart house never disappoints but i would like to see them keep up with the times a little better the world of food is extremely competitive and you can have an upscale intimate restaurant experience at plenty of other places for less money that give you more food and offer more edgy and inspiring dishes my family always defaults to the chart house for special occasions and whatnot and we're never disappointed but they're mostly old folks as a part of the younger crowd who eats out a lot and is always trying new places i can see the chart house backsliding in the industry in terms of location ambiance and an intimate or romantic environment you're going to be hard pressed to beat the chart house they have professionalism and the upscale dining experience down pat the food is good and the drinks were great but i'd just like to see a bit more out of the menu and definitely more on the plate for the prices this is 2017 if i'm going to pay over 30 for my entree you had better believe i want to see more than 2 asparagus on my plate as the side veg and i very seriously do not think that is unreasonable case and point i think that the vast majority of people who frequent the chart house do so for the environment it's professional it's classy it's romantic it's got a great view and if you take someone there and foot the bill they know you spent a pretty penny my criticism is that this just isn't enough to pull the weight these days your food has to be worth it at these prices it has to make me say wow and it just doesn't 
pizza is decent eggplant parm is excellent cheese steaks very good they deliver and quickly
who doesn't love a great steak food was amazing but the lobster was a little dry can't wait to go back for the steak and cauliflower 
this is your typical tampa cuban shithole dirty decrepit pretty much non-existent air conditioning which is necessary during the summer their cafe con leche is watery and sucks their service is pretty much one lady with an attitude problem i wish i could say there are better cuban joints but in tampa there aren't they all pretty much suck like this one 
i just purchased a new vehicle at reno nissan and was shocked at how easy and pleasant it was great test drive nice folks and i was out the door with a new lease in under 2 hours additionally they gave me a decent price for dealer trade on my old car as soon as this lease is up reno nissan will be my first choice for a new vehicle thanks to todd corey and manuel for making everything super 
who drives 40 minutes away to eat at a vegan chipotle this gringo right here vegan greengo is my culinary wet dream come true i love chipotle for the fact that they have legit vegan options however i've always wished that i can eat even more items on the menu like when they came out with their new queso why not make that cashew based instead vegan greengo makes that a reality although for a price bowls are 11 burritos 13 and nachos are 15 of course since i'll probably never be back to santa barbara not just this place i had to fork over the dough for the nachos they give you a boat of chips and stack on whatever you want the portions are quite generous and you get decent bang for your 15 bucks there were so many flavors going on but the chips in the middle did get soggy due to the refried beans still tastes great even if you have to eat it with a fork my babygirl ordered the chicken burrito and you really can't tell the difference visually from the carne asada but the real appeal is their delicious rice and refried beans the other appeal is they will load your burrito to the max if you want despite the cost you won't leave this place hungry if i were local i'd come here often most likely opting for the bowl option on a bed of spinach it seems it would be the healthiest most affordable menu item then again they'd sucker me in with 3 guacamole and i'd be right back in nacho pricing territory ugh the struggle is real 
love that i can customize the sauce for my poke bowl fish is fresh chill environment 
ordered a cheesesteak and it was the worst way too much pepper who adds pepper when cooking it and the steak was nearly non-existent looked like they used one slab of steak-um to fill a 12 inch roll as a first time customer i'm hesitant to go back 
omg so good and so authentic chipotle salsa best ever black beans and rice too highly recommended from a local 
cool coffee shop tucked in the corner near forest park and wash u kayak's always stays busy with its close proximity for students to come grab some quality coffee the mocha as always is my go to choice when i do happen to stop in the interior has an outdoorsy ski lodge vibe which is suits the food and drinks very well friendly staff good food and great drinks - a very dependable spot to get your espresso fix 
the room was decent but didn't have a phone or a fridge i wish we would have noticed that before we brought food back to the room the bathroom had some sort of heat lamp in it and was on when we got to the room so the bathroom was quite warm the hot water worked in the sink but not in the shower so they sent maintenance out to fix it this took forever they ended up providing us with a room to shower in i do hope they fix it for the next person that gets rm 174 the room was spacious 2 double beds the tv had a lot of channel choices and the pillows were comfy they also provided vouchers for breakfast not sure on their policy about dogs because it says pet friendly on the website but then explained they weren't allowed due to the hotel being close to the airport all in all an ok spot to stay for one night but i wouldnt recommend any extended stays 
this place serves their lunch and dinner menu all day who wakes up at 9 00am and wants red beans and rice this chick and it was excellent it was served with gator sausage which was grilled to perfection the boyfriend ordered chicken and waffles the chicken was marinated in a spicy glaze which he really liked ambiance here is fabulous dark old room with old fixtures andrew jackson and jean lafitte met here to discuss plans for what would come to be known as the battle of new orleans pure nola 
the interior is so outdated i felt like it was 1994 all over again there is zero modern ambiance finesse or romance the wallpaper is peeling off and the dining areas feel used the menu feels like the same thing i've seen hundreds of times and the execution is even worse i had a burger that's simple right no it was flavorless and totally unimaginative i was with a large party and saw the buffet food and i got a good look at many other dishes the food isn't fresh period it's obviously frozen and reheated nothing is homemade that i can tell maybe the carved brisket is the only genuine fresh food oh a waitress dropped a plate from another table down my mother's back and giggled nervously while saying i'm so sorry did the manager offer a free meal nope stay home next friday night and have a tv dinner it would taste the same and cost much less 
very unprofessional i called for a cab about 30-40 minutes before i needed it 10 minutes before the time i requested i got a phone call stating that my cab was outside sure enough it was i got in and everything seemed fine 10 minutes later another call your cab is outside when i told the operator that she had already sent me a cab she just told me why would you call two different cab companies don't call us again you're going on my list she promptly hung up i did not call two different cab companies they just sent two different cabs and called me two different times to notify me of that fact normally that could be eased over--administrative errors happen and i'm sure it's difficult to coordinate so many moving parts--both in terms of operators and taxis that part is understandable but to tell a client you're going on my list and hanging up when the error was theirs is beyond unprofessional it's vindictive and arbitrary and it shows a clear lack of customer service and customer concern if they're unreliable and unwilling to better themselves take customer feedback what else could be next today it was two taxis and tomorow it could be none at all when you really needed them to be honest i don't really care what list i'm on i'm never using this company again and i urge everyone to use an alternative service there's no lack of cabs in philly and i have had way better luck with all city taxi and phl 
there aren't indian restaurants near my home so i tried house of india on a recent trip what an excellent spot the food was great and the place treats you elegantly if you aren't sure you'd like it i'd take the chance i was there on a sunday night because of a work trip so i couldn't help but listen in on other conversations there were single diners families and couples of all ages- and everyone seemed to be delighted with the presentation of their food and the taste it's in a small strip mall but the inside is quite nice 
one of our favorite three restaurants in nashville my parents had the pork medallions which were perfect our waiter was great with multiple order changes and was a hero when he rustled my son up a grilled cheese with fries followed by cheesecake which was amazing i had the coconut curry salmon which is always a delight my wife got here usual as well - the french onion soup it is a meal for her and is the best i've had anywhere view of the city at dusk is great service is top notch food always always really proper i've never had a bad bite here i just wish my house were closer to it 
this is a place i love to hang out such a comfortable place to socialize they have some good wine here which might be the reason i like it so much but the food does not disappoint i've had several of the appetizers all good pizza and other main dishes have hit the target the service has been good even when i stay with my friends waaaay after our food is eaten they keep refilling water just a good feeling place - i'll be back 
great service fast service fyi take out or delivery no tables for dining service is always friendly and with a smile 
i went with 3 friends on a wednesday night and to our surprise the wait was 30 minutes lyle lovett was playing next door so that explained the wait the beer is cold and the food is hot what a plan i ordered pretzel bites for apps great followed by the salmon as recommended by our server mandy it was delicious cooked to temp sushi grade salmon with rice and veggies i will definately visit when i am in town again 
for starters buca di beppo is a family style restaurant everything is served plated to feed 3 people i really only recommend for bigger groups 4 if everyone can agree on what they want if not you're going to be going home with a lot of leftovers the service is really what left me only giving 3 out of 5 stars our waiter was nice but rather forgetful we had to ask for things multiple times before they were brought to the table 
great atmosphere awesome food perfect date place had sake green curry and the spicy salmon salad service was great not slow in my opinion but i'm european take my time when i go out to eat best thai in town in my opinion 
i bought the recent groupon for 2 eyebrow waxes my first experience was in may and it was just incredibly awkward the woman was nice but totally botched my brows i went home and hid in the bathroom to fix it before i let my boyfriend see my face additionally she pushed their products to an uncomfortable amount like tried to put them in my hands and force me to buy them however since i had bought 2 groupons i went back today to get the second wax i thought i made it clear i wanted an eyebrow wax as soon as i say down in a damp chair she told me i needed to have my face waxes my eyebrows done and she would dye them to make them look fuller i tried to be firm and so no thanks i'm fine i have blonde face hair and have never been suggested to have it waxed nor i have ever seen any to be waxed she insisted to an uncomfortable degree and because i'm a sucker i agreed after causing my face to bleed she went on to do my eyebrows and coloring them she also told me how bad my skin looked and how i needed to come back for a facial and buy 70 worth of their products and then when i went to check out my groupon eyebrow wax turned into over 40 and she gave me a deal i'm all for increasing sales and i understand small businesses but it makes me really uncomfortable when you push things on someone additionally if you're gonna push services on people at least tell them what the cost is gonna be before they agree to it overall it was an exceptionally awkward experience for a mediocre brow job 
i had not been back in awhile so i was very happy to see that their food is as great as every i had the chicken tiki marsala meal which included a drink and naan you can choose regular or garlic for 11 99 my husband did not know what he wanted and the staff were very helpful in describing the different dishes to him i ordered my meal medium which i thoroughly enjoyed however if you do not like hot and spicy you might want to consider mild or ask for a middle ground between the mild and the medium it looks like they were doing a great take out business and i will definitely have to remember that for the future 
i have had various pet-sitters over the last 20 years and none have been as good as the petcare group in their professionalism capabilities caring for elderly cats that need special treatments and following directions i wouldn't trust my home or the care of my three kitties to anyone else jen has always been amazing in her communication with me and sending me daily updates of my cats' behavior via email when we've been away on vacation everything was done to my specifications and then some 
i'm not a fan of writing a novel so i'm going to keep it short and to the point simply the best restaurant in stl i don't want to go on rant of everything i've had but let's just say everything is delicious thanks brasserie for being my go to restaurant often recommending to friends 
stopped in to get a tv bracket - not a customer service person in site finally saw a guy on his phone presumably texting i asked him where the brackets were and without looking up from his phone he pointed in no direction and said over there left the store and ordered what i needed on amazon - which is arriving this afternoon and businesses wonder why they're losing business to amazon the manager of this place needs to educate his staff on basic customer service 
begged the hubby to come here for the monday raw oyster happy hour prior to going for dinner at another great cajun restaurant got three dozens of raw oysters and they were very fresh all new orleans oysters are huge a few of these oyster from this place were as big as my hand and i have big hands i am greedy so i had most of the oysters we did not want to be cheap so we all each ordered a drink the macallan was a good pour our waiter was very understanding he did not judge me for only ordering the oysters he just confirmed that we came for the oyster happy hour and i stated that was my intend heard the other patrons stating that the food was very good as one of them stated that she has been there before would love to give this place a try for the food if we have more time in new orleans the place is comfortable and it is in a nice neighborhood 
way to expensive this hotel is lacking in everything the room was not clean we had to change sheets and there was only one towel for the five of us the front desk was dismissive and unfriendly the elevator system is the worst thing ever you have to wait 5 to 10mn to take one real problem in cleanliness this hotel is overpriced if you have a chance to book an other one take it
lunch date with my husband he goes here often but this was my first time cute little place with great food and friendly service loved the creamy salsa with the chips only problem was i ate too many chicken tacos were flavorful and tender beef taco had good flavor but a few pieces were a bit chewy menu has so many choices can't wait to go back and try more things 
the drugstore have been around for ages and every time i come home it's the go-to place for meds as well as household cleaning supplies they have the best all natural cleaning supplies air freshener and hands soaps for a low price 
we were staying at the maison dupuy hotel and this place was like a block away we already knew we wanted to try a hand grenade that we'd read about so this was our 1st stop of our trip we walked in it was like 430 in the afternoon on a tuesday and they had a band playing and the place just had a good vibe the bartenders were really friendly we ordered our grenade and stuck around for a few minutes and off we went we were too excited to just sit still lol after about 20 mins we both looked at each other and and were shocked and how quick these things were hitting us it was a great way to start off the day 
this is my 4th time here and the last i had been having a great time there the food used to be so good not this time at all the food was undercooked so i told one of the servers they took it back and cooked it more which is a big mistake for an indian dish they broke the rice - it looks like a rice pudding and the chicken still was undercooked our fries were over cooked and the wait was over 30 minutes by the way this happened when we were the only table in the restaurant very unfortunate 
really impressed went with a few friends everyone enjoyed their meal and very reasonably priced half chicken was absolutely delicious and my boyfriend who is a very harsh critic loved him pulled pork sandwich waiter was very quick and attentive will absolutely come again happy hour mon-fri 4 to 7 - 
proving ground bills itself as a coffee roaster but i would classify it as a breakfast joint the coffee selection can match a coffee shop but the quality cannot the black coffee was a bit burnt which prevented the nodes of flavor to fully come out the food however was very good the menu is full of customization for the meals to suite your taste buds it also allows for people with dietary restrictions to have a good breakfast which have to skimp on deliciousness we came with a large group and they were able to easily accommodate us you order up at the register and then they will bring your food to the table this allows for a little more casual feel which is perfect for a breakfast joint the staff was very friendly and quick with a coffee refill both of which was appreciated fully by everyone in our party if you are looking for upscale coffee you can probably find another spot however if you are looking for great breakfast food stop on in and leave with a full belly 
hmm where to start with these co ksuckers ok we begin with me coming home from a really bad day at work i get off the elevator on the 6th floor and turn the corner only to see 3inches of standing water in the hallway and the sprinkler system still going off i just freeze not knowing what to do do i brave the water get my suit soaked and try to see the damage done in my apartment or do i just turn around and leave i chose the latter i proceeded to take the elevator down to the lobby step outside and call pmc the operator answered and because it was 6pm no one else was in the office he acted annoyed and said the maintenance guy was in route to check out the problem ffwd to an hour later- the sprinkers are still going off the maintenance guy is helplessly trying to shut off the sprinklers to no avail and i'm shirtless yet still in my slacks getting rained on inside of my apartment probably the equivalent of a mild downpour cooking spaghetti water was coming out of the track lighting through the ceiling and it ruined my carpet and many important papers i had on my counter pmc's soultion is a 100 credit and they refuse to replace my carpet instead they cut out the padding from underneath and left 6 industrial sized fans and two dehumidifiers running for 7 days straight in my apartment to keep mold and mildew from forming they did this and lied to me saying that all of this would be removed within a couple of days the noise was deafening and i liken it to an engine room i couldn't even sleep in my apt for 3 days for over a weeks worth of suffering a 100 credit is a slap in the face i suggested a 250 credit and compensation for the ridiculous amount of electricity used to power the fans and dehumidifers for 7 days straight they denied me on both accounts since my electric bill did not include any ac usage as it did the month before there was not a large enough dsicrepancy for them to feel like they needed to pay me anything ffwd to a month later- i'm writing this review and my carpet has been cut down the middle of my entranceway new padding was added and some of the plaster damage has been fixed however the apt has still not been repainted the carpet looks awful an electric outlet is now dead one of my track lights is out and my closet doors are still stacked against the wall oh and i almost forgot there is still mold on the carpet in my bedroom closet from when my hot water heater was leaking 2months ago oh yeah and my dishwasher doesn't complete a cycle and will run indefinitely unless manually stopped i now just want out of my lease citing landlord negligence pmc's solution f k you you signed our ironclad lease which denies you a jury trial in the event of litigation you as the tenant are not allowed to withold rent for any reason whatsoever and you can be evicted for anything and everything please read the lease before you sign your life away to them it is the most lopsided lease i have ever seen and as a landlord myself i have see a lot of them needless to say pmc is a real peach to deal with good luck if something ever goes wrong 
so this was the first time i had been to the new location since their move the awkward part was the seating a table got seated at the right and left of us and one table is literally right next to you but at a higher level so strangers are faced at you and you can hear both tables conversations the burger was ok i remember the burgers tasting a lot better at old location service was good and another person also asked if our burgers were tasting good all and all a good time
i lost count how many times i've been to le shio in the past but i've never been disappointed in almost anything i've eaten there and the service is usually good the trick is knowing when to order take-out vs when to dine in as this place can easily get crowded during weekend nights late friday night 12 26 my boyfriend and i came here with my sister and her husband for dinner our server was very nice if a little timid she pronounced her name yenise and she brought our food out relatively quickly for starters we split the shrimp shumai appetizer about 6 dumplings and they were delicious if a bit on the small side as for drinks my sister ordered a glass of geikkekan plum wine i took a sip and liked it so much my boyfriend and i ended up ordering a second glass to share between us it was sweet yet tangy and had a rich robust flavor my sister's husband had a bottle of kirin ichiban beer and i decided to play it safe and stick to water for my entree i had the spicy dancing kani and famous han rolls both were excellent although i think the spicy dancing kani edged out the famous han slightly in overall flavor it was topped with shredded cooked crab meat and stuffed with avocado and tempura flakes i honestly don't know what the sauce was but it was mildly spiced and did not overwhelm my taste buds highly recommended the famous han roll was topped with salmon and filled with tamago striped bass and avocado and it was drizzled in a brown sauce that i at first thought was soy but it tasted more like mirin mixed with soy and vinegar also quite good and the portions were a decent manageable size there are some sushi places i've been to where the food is good but the sizes of the pieces they serve are so huge you can't possibly fit them in your mouth and have to end up nibbling away at them and ultimately make a mess of the roll and yourself not the case with le shio bravo to them for demonstrating portion control my sister ordered the sweet potato tempura roll and individual pieces of tuna salmon yellowtail barbecued eel and shrimp sushi along with salmon roe i tried some of the sweet potato tempura and i really enjoyed it it had a crunchy layer above the rice that added a nice solid texture to the roll i also had the tuna sushi and liked it the best roll of the night for me was the stacy roll my boyfriend ordered it was topped with avocado and stuffed with spicy tuna absolutely delicious i will make a point of having this the next time i come here my boyfriend also had the yellowcab roll yellowtail with scallions which he liked i didn't have enough of an appetite to sample anything from my brother-in-law's plate but what he had looked tasty a philly roll a twin tuna roll seared tuna with fried onions and avocados and topped with spicy tuna and a wasabi sauce and a kyoto tempura roll shrimp tempura with cream cheese also topped with spicy tuna i did have an appetite for dessert and initially chose a slice of red velvet cake sadly i was denied the pleasure of eating said cake as le shio ran out of them so i got the chocolate caramel cake instead while my sister had the pistachio cheesecake unfortunately here is where i have to subtract a star my dessert was good but reminded me of one of those toll house or duncan hines microwave-bake desserts you pop in the microwave for 30 seconds to enjoy after dinner the actual cake was a little on the dry side and the caramel filling inside was hot enough to almost burn my tongue my sister's dessert wasn't bad per se but it didn't taste like pistachio or cheese or anything really it was also very cold which suggested that it was taken straight out of a refrigerator before it was put on a plate in short if you come to le shio be sure to stick to sushi and leave dessert alone -p
don't bother you would rather starve i promise imagine a bunch of microwaveable food that has been cooked then it has been placed in the fridge for three days then it is reheated and delivered to you that is new tower pizza 
my first visit was 3 weeks ago a drop in manicure with gel polish i was very impressed with the service i got everyone else very friendly and i didn't have to wait my manicure still looked perfect after 15 days i tried a mani pedi a few days ago again i just walked in and was seen to immediately i had one person do my pedi and a different woman do my mani both did a great job and it was very relaxing i didn't feel rushed and i felt time and care was taken thank you and keep doing what you're doing 
the chicken and andouille gumbo is absolutely sensational i could just order a bowl and be satisfied but the apps small plates entrees and desserts are spectacular great atmosphere as well as a great location 5 stars excellent 
i've lived the last year above juliennes and went there the first time a couple weeks ago this place is life altering i want to eat here all the time where do i even start - went on a saturday evening and they were busy but the hostess girl took my cell phone number and said she would call when a table is ready there's plenty of little places to get wine or just walk around while you wait she called and said our table would be ready in about 5 minutes so we could start heading over - neighborhood welcome champagne yes please - all the servers and cooks are fun and friendly they give you instant reg treatment - charcuterie get the duck liver - we were originally going to get the 5 course tasting and wine pairing but our server said its a lot of food and recommended the 3 i'm glad we did plenty of food - just have them pick the food because they know better than you - all wine is local but you'll find a few from the willamette valley because of the chef being from there - the captain crunch ice cream is fun and takes you back to your saturday morning cartoons as child this is my favorite restaurant probably ever for sure in all sb it's not trying to be a new trendy place that focuses on industrial hipster decor it's focus is on the food and you will leave full and most importantly satiated 
i would highly recommend the burrito grande and the table side guacamole both had great flavor and generous proportion sizes the staff was also very friendly loved it and would definitely go back 
avoid this place you'll be doing yourself favour first off 27 for three single tasteless cheeseburgers cooked to the consistency of fine shoe leather second while ordering my kids meal which includes a drink the girl taking my order informed me she would charge me for bottled water instead of the juice third they forgot my kids fries and when i asked for them the gentleman looked quite annoyed to cap off this wonderful experience i told the girl taking my order three times that one of the cheeseburgers was to go when they all came out on the tray to stay and i reminded her a 4th time she handed me a box and bag needless to say i should have gone to shake shack hell even burger king would have been a better option 
my mom and i went to kiva for a mother daughter spa date three days before my wedding the spa is amazing i had a full body facial and my mom had a facial i had no complaints it was so perfect and so relaxing my mom loved her facial her only complaint was getting an extra charge for a brow tint which she never asked for we also had spa manicures and pedicures they were okay could've had better manicures and pedicures at a regular nail salon overall great spa we will be returning 
walking in on a rather quite tuesday night i met up with a few of my fellow industry pals at the playground and was welcomed by a cool ambiance and a great energy the pretzels were ordered not once but twice and were described by yours truly as pillows of goodness smothered in a delicious cheese sauce it was the perfect accompaniment to a couple of beers the only issue i had was the waitress she didn't seem all there and gave us delayed responses and blank stares let's just say she was under the category of 'special people' among our discussion so it wasn't just me that thought this i've heard mixed reviews but i was pleasantly surprised and would come back for a repeat experience maybe minus the airhead waitress 
i love the food from jersey mikes i also really like the owner of this particular store good food usually quick and good service i have to say i would eat here much more often if they used their hood system i smell like a cheesesteak when i leave this location i know this sounds silly but next time you go smell your clothes it's for real they have an exhaust hood but it is never turned on turn it on sell more of your delicious subs- guaranteed 
it's a pretty nice theater the tickets are inexpensive and i always order them ahead of time on fandango this cinema does reserved seating so that's always nice the decor and look of the theater is amazing but the seats are less comfortable i would just bring a jacket and use it to prop up my lower back or use my purse 
driving by saw this had to stop wow really eclectic bunch of people loved it dog friendly each bar has different selection of drafts great selection of local beers also lots of seating quite a few games to play cool place to meet peeps great to just hang out and drink will be coming back here 
this is a fun quirky place to hang out their main draw is the large collection of board games and card games the servers are very attentive and knowledgeable and the food is delicious i had hummus as an appetizer and it was the best i've ever tasted the vegetable rice bowl was good too and the portions were generous i highly recommend pieces to anyone wanting to try something a little different 
i enjoy delicious coffee beverages here on tuesdays and thursday mornings and they probably think i'm just stealing their free wifi while enjoying the view from the beautifully landscaped patio but in reality well ok maybe i am 
i just saw heather for a massage and pedicure oh my goodness i get a massage frequently and she was hands down the best massage i've ever had she read my intake form perfectly i never had to correct her during the massage for her pressure in different areas it all flowed wonderfully i'm very satisfied i'm sad i don't live in the area otherwise i'd see her as much as possible thanks heather 
no stars got there at 6 15 pm they close at 8 00 pm called ahead for an oil change and they assured me they could get it done when i pulled out my fleet card they quickly changed their tune and said it would take too much time to call enterprise for approval and that they couldn't fit me in lazy 
i was there on an august weekend for an early dinner this was a place i used to visit with my dad about 15 years ago or more back then they had great sandwiches a nice welcoming vibe and the best french onion soup my dad ever tasted someone posted in a recent review summer 2019 that it has new owners it shows the menu isn't great - lacks a bit of variety and both our meals were just ok not bad not great just ok prices were about average inside on the bar side the decor seems a little schizophrenic - whitewashed walls dark walnut booths with 80s green faux leather brass-rail bar with a bright - god was it bright - white tiled pizza oven area and tv's everywhere honestly when i first walked in i thought they might be in the middle of redecorating if there had been a ladder over our booth with a paint can hanging overhead it would have made sense all that being said our waitress was a total pro attentive without being pushy she made sure we never lacked for drinks waited until we'd actually tried a bite or two before asking how everything was and seemed extremely nice and welcoming to us for the service i'd consider going back for the look of the place and the so-so food maybe not so much 
this is a must this place is downright the coolest south philly spot the vegan menu is killing the game and the brisket sandwich is bonkers i had a tomato pie too with vegan parm this spot is a must must must for any philadelphia vegan 
it says diner and nothing says diner like dessert you know what i mean fluffy pies and cakes so one night we went in for dessert around 6pm we were seated and left to our menus we couldn't find dessert on the menu eventually a server came and said we rarely if ever have dessert he didn't even try and interest in anything else on the menu very strange so we left and went down the street to a diner that serves diner food including dessert won't return 
uber eat an order ask for ketchup on two different orders ketchup did not arrive called and chris manager blamed uber driver and took zero responsibility even tho it was clearly on uber order twice they refused to pick up call after manager chris hung up on me for yelling at his poor soul after blaming the uber driver horrible manger all i wanted was sorry they refused to answer for ten minute and finally a brave employee antnaa i know i spelled that wrong sorry answered and finally just said i am sorry manager pos chris did not have fortitude to even answers can that bitch chris and promote the employee he probably told to answer the phone 
we finally got to try ebru today it was a great experience the one gentleman in the coffee area was very attentive the entire time from explaining the menu their kitchen and checking in on us how the drinks were this will quickly become our weekend coffee shop 
looking for a vegan breakfast grab your coffee next door and order your breakfast at farmacy located inside duckweed 
god help you if you ever have to visit this godforsaken place prepare to spend hours and more likely then not when you finally get to a human they will send you off to do something and get back in line again my suggestion is to find out if one of the private companies like the notary shoppe at 504 st andrews next to the walmart on tchoup for a tiny fee they can usually take care of whatever thing you need that an omv visit would get you 
this is not a company i would recommend the salesman never explained that we were locking us into a 3 year contract after year one i called to cancel the service and was told it was a binding contract and that we could not cancel they offered to cut the monthly price by 7 00 but they wanted me to commit to another 5 year contract in addition to the 2 years left on our contract or they would drop the price by 5 00 if we committed to another 2 years a very unfriendly customer retention specialist called us at 9 00 pm at night to give us this information we've had services from other companies for home protection and had great service and customer service be aware no stars from us 
this was probably the worst indian food i've ever tasted they were very kind when i picked up the order but it did not make up for the food that followed the chicken biyrani was terrible- the chicken was dry and tasted like old meat the dal had no flavor and the palak aloo tasted like sewage i'm not trying to be mean but it was inedible for me we literally had to go to the indian restaurant tandoor indian in murfreesboro we love just to get it redeemed this evening bc we couldn't even continue eating it yikes i hope you can improve on fresher food but honestly won't be able to try again 
good food and completely forgot i got a chance to work there for a little bit fired me too do too menu test and oops got free shirts and shift beer and gave my all thanks you hush puppies are killer and kiki was a cool as hell and thats my opinion see you soon i hope beer is cold as the management if you not a girl or somthin like that
what can i say other then this place has great pizza it's my neighborhood steak and pizza joint and has been a family favorite probably for 30 years yes the pizzas are smaller compared to other pizza places and yes they're a much higher cost of other pizza places but it's family run homemade with great ingredients you won't regret the extra cost another favorite dish is the t-bone steak dinner with baked potato wonderful 
on our trip out to tn this was our dinner spot on our first night and our last night of our trip it was great way to start our trip and we just had to stop in before heading home there are some great southern comfort food choices on this menu we craved the smoked wings for an appetizer there is nothing like it anywhere else the skin is seasoned so well the meat is tender and moist and holds that authentic smoked flavor my dh ordered the dirty bird sound funny but was tasty but fair warning it was also a bit messy i ordered a mixed plate of fried catfish bbq cauliflower cole slaw breading was simple and not overdone the fish flakey and a good size filet the sides were good just the cole slaw was a bit too watery on our next visit out we had the hot chicken plates the were very yummy good balance of sauce to chicken and not too spicy drinks were inventive and delicious i had a betty jean on our first dinner out and a category 5 at our last dinner i think the category 5 was better drink but to be honest after a week in whiskey bourbon country i was preferring that over vodka i wish this place was here in my town so i could visit them for dinner again soon 
david was a great server very knowledgeable in his side dishes and gave great service the food is always good can't complain about the taste as it's super authentic 
we did the food and history tour with ben he was super knowledgeable friendly able to answer all our questions and funny the food was fabulous this might be one of our favorite things we do on this trip 
going down hill the menu recently changed and is overall underwhelming they got rid of the burnt end pasta which was the best thing on the menu won't be coming back sadly
update it has a mexican ice cream place attached where you can order on either the ice cream side or at the restaurant you can order aguas awesome 
i would go back the best homemade flour tortillas the food was delicious and hot and more than enough food i couldn't eat it all and that's unbelievable this place is located next to tough competition they hold their own being located next to one of the best restaurants in the city subculture caf which is also five stars 
we had buffet on christmas night fantastic experience the food is so delicious and the seafood is so so fresh 
horrible we took the bundle for phone computer and tv the phone service is very bad and forget calling 411 they never have the number even though i know it is listed i have a new computer and high speed service but it couldn't be slower if it tried i have had other cable services in other parts of the country and never had such poor service as i have had with comcast 
high quality and affordable master plumbers are hard to find i had grable out earlier today for the 2nd time this year and it hit me how important it is to share my experiences to other prospective consumers in need of plumbing services first i researched the local landscape and considered yelp google and angie's list reviews and concluded grable along with one potential other were the best bet in town for quality price back in march i called and paul came out the next day to replace the malfunctioning main water valve of an ybor property i purchased paul was clearly an expert plumber very professional and replaced the main valve along with washer dryer water heater and other valves quickly and with a warranty guaranteed by grable the price was excellent and probably the best possible deal one could have done yesterday i had picked up a new bath sink faucet from lowe's and wanted some add'l work done i called grable and mario came out this morning it took him barely 2 hrs to install the sink faucet rebuild the toilet handle flapper clear the bath drain replace the bath spigot and showerhead mario's work and professionalism was apparent there is a big difference when a master plumber gets to work versus a handyman or the proverbial friend who can do any plumbing job cheap which makes me cringe btw anyway i'm being wordy as i think this detail is important solid 5 stars for grable i'm sticking with them and trust them and will recommend them to anyone especially friends and family in the tampa area 
go to this place for the best cuban food in st pete i will seriously never get tired of the floridian 
how hard is it people ordered 1 chicken super burrito and 1 asada super burrito even when got to window was asked did you have the 2 burritos 1 chicken 1 beef so we leave drive thru and start eating and guess what 2 chicken no asada again how hard is it to make 2 simple burritos no mas for me it's not like the menu is so vast 
we took our 8 year old niece and her friend here for a crafty afternoon huge almost overwhelming selection of things to create both kids had a wonderful time and one of them pronounced i've never had so much fun in 8 years helpful staff and friendly not cheap but fun 
great addition to the area i got some treats before xmas the caramel cinnamon donuts lived up to the hype the pecan rolls are to die for huge gooey and totally loaded with pecans never had one so good other than my mom's the cinnamon bun was a disappointment as it had way way too much icing the nut crunch candy is very good - kind of a cross between peanut brittle and a praline soft and easy to eat they are getting their wings at this location and cashier staff is still learning 
highly recommend this place if you have not had the opportunity to ever try an empanada arepa or teque o this is the perfect place to do so you won't regret it everything was absolutely delicious and the place had a great atmosphere too i never post reviews but indy has to know that this place is killer 
so disappointed in this store was with att for 12 years but the rates got out of control up to 200 a month in fees so happy i switched to google fi i pay 30 a month the people at att seamed nice but i felt lied to numerous times
i came here to celebrate a birthday and there was a very short wait for how busy it was the hostess rion and our waiter jason were amazing i cannot explain how accommodating and just overall awesome jas n was though he had a full section and still made time to make our dinner feel very personable i'm so looking forward to our next visit i'm not on trip advisor but i hope this review still gives jason and rion the recognition and acknowledgement they deserve 
i had the chicken picatta with a bottle of rombauer chardonnay and the french onion soup to start let's start with the french onion soup it was fabulous absolutely the best i have ever had the chicken picatta super flavorful their wine selection was impressive for a new restaurant i can honestly say this will be my new go to restaurant when i don't have time to cook 
we had wonderful take out meals we wanted lunch and dinner so we ordered a porchetta sandwich for lunch and crawfish etouffee for the following evening's dinner we decided to split each dish and make an extra generous side salad we could have eaten each as a single meal but with the semi-quarantine we are not getting enough exercise to warrant big meals we just finished the etouffee which we served over brown rice it was heavenly absolutely heavenly charlie and i will order again soon usually we live in san carlos mexico but are now in tucson for an extended visit pending surgery there's no better way to keep up our morale and also support a local restaurant than ordering from feast 
filing a complaint with the bbb resolved this issue it is unfortunate it took that to get this business's attention but all's well that ends well 
the best general tso at a chinese take-out i have ever had i've never tasted better the chicken is very tender and the sauce does not over power your taste buds i've constantly recommended the tso and never have i been given a negative review about it 
5 stars it's an ice cream shop with about 30 flavors the cones are stacked the prices are not friendly staff you'll see your neighbors there and meet new folks from abroad pick up a frequent visitor card fill up the card and get a free cone what a deal yep as good as it gets 
just ok i was hyped by all the positive reviews but our experience didn't match up grilled calamari was a standout but the linguine and white clam was disappointing tasted like way to much sweetness and nutmeg added and the pasta was odd not the caliber i am used to also if they dimmed the lights and chilled out on the service pace it's be a way better experience 
all the hype about this place from my friends i had to try it since i've never been to one ever well first visit they screwed up on my pasta scampi which i asked for no tomatoes on it and it was all over my plate when i received it the server apologized and had them make me a new one that came and it was so so salty but no tomatoes the mngr came over and asked if everything was good now and i said no i can't eat it because it's so salty she apologized and said they probably had to much salt in the water when they cooked the pasta i decided to skip the pasta and order the fish and chips which was pretty good however the fries were burnt and the server even noticed it when she brought it out and asked if i wanted new ones i said no since i had been waiting a long time at this point because of the pasta fiasco i just ate the fish so a month later my husband wanted to try this place he ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger medium cooked it came out raw they took it back since he only took one bite and they brought him the same burger by the time the burger came back i was already done with my meal the mngr on duty had the nerve to tell my husband that in the future ask for it medium well and it will come out medium really how about working out the kinks of your kitchen where the food is good and consistent each and everytime we could have easily paid 5 ala carte at 5 guys up the street for a cooked burger and saved 8 since the burger was like 13 bucks poor quality of food and managers aren't customer service oriented this place is over expensive for the quality of food they serve won't be back 
i have never left a review for anyone before this but this hotel was great brand new so still a little construction going on but excellent staff and great rooms the managers jeff and james were especially friendly 
for several months a friend of mine has been telling me that leaning tower has the best pizza in new port richey last night i finally got the chance to try it for myself we were greeted warmly by staff and the owner and seated ourselves in a comfortable booth our server one of the previously mentioned twins was prompt and attentive i'm starting to like this place and wondering why it took me so long to find it after a bit of debate on how to top our pizza we ordered a large pepperoni pie it was quite good in fact i'm finishing the last of it for my breakfast as i type borrowing from lieutenant colonel bill kilgore i love the smell of pizza in the morning it it the absolute best pizza in new port richey go in for yourself and decide is it among the best in new port richey absolutely i'm looking forward to returning several more times to go through the rest of the menu 
we go every year for anniversary for the past 4 years and last night we went for my wife's birthday with a group of 8 people it was absolutely perfect from the staff to the food everything was a 10 and the cherry on top was getting the whole restaurant to sing my wife happy birthday thank you chefs and wait staff for making the night special andrew stevie
best pizza ever garlic knots are a must fun hangout for the neighborhood kids best homemade gravy true family feel they always remember us and what we order sandwiches are decent and wings are my favorite salads are huge but they need to upgrade to romaine or arugula over iceberg 
i hesitate telling anyone on yelp about one of my new fav restaurants in santa barbara it is intimate de lupus fresh and so reasonable the owner is from ethiopia and delightful loved the eggless kale caesar and sole with capers just delicious outside tables to being pups in beautiful la arcada court absolutely 5 stars 
i've got one word for you rugelach tiny flaky buttery and tender they mix everything you love - sweet and fat fruit and nut they're truly bite size which i love they come wrapped in a pretty little bag reminding me of a purchase from a boutique and really it is cosi dolce is a boutique bakery just a tiny wisp of a place painted in pink with sweet little nooks filled with baked goodies there's only room for two small bar tables the locals really love this place and the owner became well known from selling items at the ferguson farmers market everyone told her she should open her own place and she listened they sell typical american bakery items like lemon bars muffins cupcakes and brownies nothing fancy but if you like comfort-based familiar sweets you'll love this place 
convinced my boyfriend to come here instead of getting a pizza that night i came across this place on yelp and the many good reviews convinced me to come here we ordered the baked brie appetizer which was just okay in my opinion i felt like there was too much oil the bibb lettuce salad was refreshing and we shared that to get some greens in our systems then we ordered the seafood and paella for 1 trust me you don't need to order the one for 2 if there is 2 of you because the order for one is huge we couldn't finish it and it was definitely delicious i would come back and order it again the inside interior was modern and seems like a place we could come back to if not for drinks then more paella 
first time out with the girlfriend and we stopped by here first heard of the brewery at industrial eats another great place family owned local and friendly covid protocol and santa barbara health department compliant no politics here great beer with great conversation got served by the brewers bring your mask and your liver joseph
was there last night for a program hosted by a drug company the service was not so great some of the servers were rude and made rude comments to the guests we got served a caesar salad that was wilted and warm and the croutons were half toasted plain bread i sat over an hour with an empty drink thank god not everyone was drinking their waters at the table i will say that the steak was good i only had a couple of bites since our food came so late i really had my hopes up high about this place because i had heard so many good things but last night was such a disaster and disappointment i'm not sure i would want to go again 
i placed an order through the tropical smoothie cafe app when i arrived 10 min after time ready i did not see my food in the cube i asked the associate shamyra about my order and she wasn't helpful at all she explained to me that she did not see my order in her system i proceeded to show her my order confirmation and let her know what i ordered she let me know that she couldn't do anything for me and that it will be a loss if she was to make my order at that time i am baffled because not only did i show her my order confirmation tropical smoothie cafe has already taken my money she also was trying to explain the system to me and being a paying customer the system is the least of my worries she proceeded to go back and forth with me on how she was not going to remake or take care of the order i had already paid for finally the owner without urgency came over and received my order it took maybe 15 more minutes before i was even taken care of i do understand i went at prime time lunch and sometimes things can get behind but the service i received today was unacceptable i love this restaurant and was so excited to have one in stl but i am very disappointed this is nothing like the tropical smoothie cafe i've previously visited 
great breakfast right on the beach biscuits and gravy was excellent pancakes are great and the breakfast burrito large portions enough to share 
tonight i ordered something new on the menu it was called baked ragatoni with tomato sauce and mozzarella when it came out it had something else added in tasted like goat cheese which i hate when i called over the waiter and said what is this she came back and said it was goat cheese disgusting but then a gentleman came over i think head of catering named david schmidt and said he would make me a new one without the goat cheese and informed me that his recipe stated with goat cheese and the menu was wrong i feel that carrabba's is lucky to him him on there staff as he sat down with us and explained everything a very polite and professional person thank you david schmidt for explaining and keeping a frequent customer happy i am giving 5 stars not for the food but for david schmidt
went for my friend's birthday and had the best time rachel was so helpful and taught us how to improve our form and was very patient 
last evening i got take out of the gnocchi with blush sauce and the orange whipped ricotta the gnocchi was absolutely delicious but from the perspective of trying something very different the ricotta appetizer knocked it out of the park mercato consistently delivers delicious food but the next time you order you have to try the ricotta 
i'm asking all my friends to boycottuber and only use lyft friday night i got a request for a guy named joshua at the casino i called to let him know i had a support dog and asked if there were any allergies he was very rude and demanded that i just get there now i politely said i just dropped off my last fare and i'm on my way i arrived to a barrage of insults and and demands i informed him that i didn't have to take him anywhere and said yes i did i told him to get out he continued to bark a mouthful of insults and threatened me that i don't understand how this works at the time i thought it was an odd threat at the time he finally backed out i canceled the ride and chose the rider behavior option i drove off to continue my shift not 30 seconds later i was paired with him again i was shocked i couldn't believe uber would pair me with a rider i declined because of bad behavior i canceled the ride which affects my percentage and bottom line not his i started to call uber and shockingly enough they paired us again i informed uber of everything that happened and went about my evening at 2 00am i got a notification that my uber account was shut down and i needed to contact uber i read my messages and it said someone had reported me for being under the influence i was stunned but i was sure i could clear this up and i knew now what joshua meant by i didn't understand how this works i called and explained what he was doing and that i was over 3 years sober and infact had a cop friend sitting not 100 feet from me that i could get a breathalyzer test from to proove it they declined immediately and said their investigation team would be reaching out to me in 4-8 hours i said this is unbelievable why is your system set up so i can be attacked and now a small petty angry abusive man is allowed to make false allegations against a driver with a 5 star rating and compliments from just about every passenger i've had they said that's their protocol i informed them that they needed to change their protocol and protect their valued highly rated drivers and not angry vindictive sociopaths i then asked to know exactly what their investigation included and they told me they couldn't tell me another thing when they shut down the account they also shut down access to the money you've already earned for the night boycottuber
favorite mediterranean spot in santa barbara best dish is the salmon plate love love it here during this social distancing they are offering home delivery great spot 
we love it we moved here from texas two years ago and have been searching for a good mexican restaurant this is the place good margaritas food service 
i had never heard of basque and i'm not too comfortable trying new food but omg they have the best food and the service is great we'll definitely be going back oh and be sure to bring an appetite because you get a lot 
met my wife there for lunch she got the taco salad and i got the tacos al carbon both were really good as always we've been coming every few weeks for years now don't remember ever getting a bad meal absolutely love the green sauce they bring out 
i've been a customer of rudy's for over a year now and i've never had someone who knows my hair as well as i do he joined toppers a little while back and that gives me confidence in their talent selection i've also had a facial there and it was amazing my skin really did glow afterwards ask for kelli - she does a really good job i think i've picked up an expensive habit 
my experience at this place started well friendly waitress although the place looks like it could use a makeover the appetizers were very good the octopus was cooked well and it tasted very good stuffed mushrooms were also very good my daughter's falafel plater was tasty but i ordered the combo kabobs with spinach orso the beef kabob was overcooked and the orso was tasteless my waitress disappeared until the end of our meal showed up with the bill when i told her about the situation she said she wished she would of cooked it herself to make it right and then rushed to take the check because she was leaving i will probably still comeback for the octopus
best place to go for holidays and sunday brunches great atmosphere and food quality that rivals any center city mid-level restaurant love love the harvest salad it is not usually on the menu but they will make it for me anyway amazing soups chicken salad sandwich is to die for and deserts are incredible they have the very best mothers day and easter brunches around the bloody mary's mimosas and coffee are excellent too it gets very crowded on holidays but the brunch buffets are worth it robins nest is a terrific restaurant and one i highly recommend we also love going to a few of the shops in mill village afterwards they are so overlooked but have the best gift giving ideas i frequently go to the shops behind the robins nest before the holidays to stock up on gifts for the adults 
it was over 40 minutes of waiting between appetizers and entrees the restaurant was clearing out and we were still waiting for our pasta after 10 30pm actually asked to cancel to order because of the wait but they wrapped it up for us it's still sitting in the fridge good appetizers but the total 1 5 hour wait for entrees is unacceptable and ruined the ruined the very expensive experience 
worst burger king ever service is always horrible and the staff aren't nice or friendly at all they sometimes keep advertising promotional products that they no longer offer they are kind of slow too
this is such a cute place for a nice italian meal i had the gnocchi with gorgonzola and it was amazing the atmosphere is very sweet and pretty quiet i never had to strain my voice even at a large table for people to hear me would recommend for anyone looking for a nice intimate meal 
love their menu and especially the croissants when you walk in you to the store do you have this fear is amazing takes you back to party friends 
i'm torn between writing a rave review and keeping this place a secret but the owner chef deserves praise and major success this place absolutely rivals dizengoff and i couldn't be more excited to have it in the neighborhood they have a diverse menu serve their hummus warm and offer whole wheat pita everything was delicious and authentic and super well priced this is most definitely going to become a staple i don't think it's long before the rest of philly finds out about this place and the line is out the door so get here while you can 
one of the best meals of my life it's italian the way you want it to be- well seasoned proper portions classic but fresh we dined with another couple and had bread with basil compound butter amazing diver scallops veal and short rib ragu over gnocchi all of it was delicious and the ambiance is perfect very nyc cannot wait to return and although we aren't locals we'll plan another trip just to eat here again 
i ordered a 1 topping large chicago deep dish i feel like i got ripped off this is not chicago deep dish but more of a pan pizza style see my photos of their brochure vs real thing needs a lot more cheese and crust was to thick on bottom the chef salad was good i really enjoyed the house dressing my wife and son enjoyed the wings 
loved this little place the name alone hooked me but everyone that worked there was great with a huge smile on their face i had the pumpkin chai whoopie pie and could have had four more wish i was close enough to visit often 
my old wooden 16 foot by 7 foot garage door was broken beyond repair the installation guys came out yesterday and replaced it fast clean efficient and perfectly done oh and they called prior to coming came when they said they would and even cleaned up the garage a bit highly recommend 
only gets 1 star because the service was great considering how bad the wings were how the manager asked me how to do his job when we told him we couldn't eat the wings they were over breaded i nearly bit into a bloody wing never again rally's has better quality wings 
great service we have a very small office and cant afford a full time it person nor would it make sense brandon combines convenience and affordability a 
this restaurant definitely has some of the most authentic szechuan cuisine in the area before there was another restaurant called lailai brothers that had the szechuan cuisine recently lailai brothers merged with lailai garden the food is still excellent as always when i went to their new location i would definitely request the authentic chinese menu dishes i recommend bamboo with pork seafood hot and sour soup dan dan noodles 
thoroughly enjoyed spending a afternoon at this antique store impressive booths display many wonderful heirlooms today's adventure consists of looking for asian artifacts appreciated the way each booth's displayed spacious presentation allows you to take your time as you browse i'm adding this treasure to my list of favorites 
this place is alright it gets annoying having people come up to you every 5 min making it seem like you're trying to steal stuff literally i would walk in crazy random paths just to see if this guy would continue to stick stuff by me and he did the entire time 
wanna make crankie frankie happy take him to the ball park took a well deserved day off and wife and headed to yankee stadium south yanks vs the hated red sox i'm a native ny'er and wife is a native ri'er so our baseball teams hate each other well probably not the players because they're from wherever but the fans do it can get downright brutal anyway this is a first class spring training facility yes it is mlb but it's spring training folks the yelpers who complained about this obviously have never been to a spring training game before try going to cactus league games in arizona steinbrenner field is light years better anyway that is the reason why we go to spring training more relaxed more fun not regular season intense the stadium is immaculate clean well kept up lots of fresh paint but frankly i expected all this it's the yankees the premier baseball franchise high expectations are the norm very comfy seats you're not all smashed together like in some major league stadiums oakland a's and s f giants hello very good food choices yes it's pricey but you knew that right this is a large spring training stadium wife said fenway's not much bigger the staff at the stadium deserves a high five for being great and very nice to the fans yanks won 8-1 so all is well with the world i have been to more bb games than i care to admit but i've never taken a 7 minute bee delay oh yeah it happened due to a swarm in left field they even attacked the bosox left fielder smart bees 
what could be better beautiful park in mostly beautiful evenings with free excellent music food drinks people mingling a great way to spend 8-10 weekday evenings in the spring summer bring a chair or walk around vendors selling art crafts photography and clothes items it's a good time see you there 
i have been to many restaurants in my life and this one does so not deserve to be in the 5 star category why you ask one simple word not because of the taste it's the portions wow you order a rigatoni dish you literally receive 16 rigattonis at like 19 bucks a pop who does that no one portions are ridiculously small guys you might be the hot thing today but respect your clients this is an italian place portions should be decent 
the pho was very good i had the beef with no meatballs it was savory and the broth was well seasoned and not just colored water the noodles were plentiful as was the beef i ordered it not spicy and it was perfect they do have not hat option for those who prefer some heat i think the side herbs and bean sprouts could have been just a little more plentiful but it was enough to satisfy the service was friendly and accommodating the atmosphere is very casual and like a typical take-away with inside seating although it is a thai eatery they did a good job with this vietnamese dish i'm looking forward to returning to try their thai cuisine i recommend this place it is in a quaint little strip of multi-cultural shops just off main street 
i am a huge fan of the wingstop chain and was very happy to find out there's one near me wingstop is my go to when i'm craving wings to eat during the game i prefer the traditional wings with bone over boneless because the chicken is always juicier when the bone is involved when it comes to flavors i typically go with original hot garlic parmesan and lemon pepper in addition to their phenomenal wings they also have really good french fries that are perfectly seasoned i am a huge ranch fan so i love to dip my fries and wings in their ranch in my opinion wingstop has some of the best ranch you can get at a chain if you're craving wings then you have got to check out wingstop as far as chains go their service is decent but nothing special most of the time when i order my wings in advance they're ready when i arrive but there have been times when they have been super behind all in all they get the job done 
line out the door really great shrimp noodle big prawns excellent if you ever here stop in 
cute lil place with a nice menu everything was tasty and good customer service i can honestly say the glass of wine was huge and the escargot was by far the best we have ever had it could use some serious updating but the food is well worth the trip 
this place has kind employees but their attention to detail is lacking even with a giant tip to hopefully ensure a careful polish there's as much on my skin as there is on my nails 
awesome pizza place great service and pizza- goes to a great cause the owners walt and judy are fantastic headed to get pizza again as we speak 
i gave them only two stars because of their service actually more because of their attitude i ran into the same thing with both trattoria mollie and the noodle restaurant in the public market both had have great service in their sb location but at their montecito they had attitude over service here when i ordered a pastry they didn't bother to ask if it was for there or to go when she put it in a bag and i said it was for there i got a sigh along with the plate then she only filled my cup 3 4 without asking if i needed room for milk well i drink it black so i don't and since the coffee is behind the counter you cannot warm it up when half full and no one asked if i needed it warmed up the other locations are self service so you can warm it up yourself pastries still great 
after reviewing the menu i was totally underwhelmed at the selection so i was in incredibly skeptical about my dinner but the midwest poke bowl with chicken was sooooo good i just couldn't believe it all the veggies were fresh crisp the sticky rice was absolutely perfect and the sauce dressing was delicious the selection of games was outstanding so the kids had a blast and the staff couldn't have been nicer more attentive or more helpful if you're looking for a fun place for dinner with preteens teens i highly recommend this place 
im new to vaping and i visited this little jewel on yesterday the staff was very helpful when helping me choose the perfect juice to get me started on my vaping journey i will definitely continue to do business with calhoun vapor 
the service here was sooo slow we could of taken a nap and still been waiting for our food and beer this dude needs caffeine before clocking in 
three stars mostly for being totally lame and having no cones none only waffle bowls what are you thinking tried grandma's oreo cookie - delish banana pudding - delish - a few more nilla wafers in it please caramel vanilla pecan - not enough caramel and pralines were chopped up into small pieces ice cream is nice and creamy - counter gal was super sweet and helpful but cones please and thank you 
we got the butterfly pea latte it takes great but i guess the price is too much for the small amount of tea the place is small so it might not for people who likes quiet cafes 
after a perm mishap chemically burned over 4inches of my hair off bev at salon pasca was able to restore my hair's health with their conditioning treatments and their products my hair has been growing 1inch a week now these ladies know what they're doing 
the positive is that the hotel was affordable because most hotels in the nashville area were way over priced the hotel did offer a shuttle that takes you downtown for 10 round trip per person which is awesome because an uber ride at peak hours on the way back was 40 the beds were hard and creaked but we weren't in the hotel long the hotel was really outdated and had a huge dirty appearance to it when i checked it it was after hours and i had to go to a window and could not be let into the lobby 
admittedly maybe embarrassingly i previously considered krispy kreme donuts the gold standard then i had these and came to my senses truly the best yeast donuts i've ever eaten puffy slightly chewy melt-in-your-mouth perfection i think it says something when the plain glazed is one of the best don't even need any toppings to disguise these things that being said the maple nut creme is out of this world too when i'm feeling particularly gluttonous i go with the coconut custard haven't tried their cake donuts but any of the yeast should be solid they frequently don't make it all the way home but if i somehow manage not to eat them on the spot warming them for a few seconds is amazing we even had them as treats for our wedding there's usually a wait but the line moves quickly and these are soo worth it 
why are the wings fried so damn hard felt like i was biting into rocks they were not enjoyable at all the season fries were ok there's a reason this place was completely empty when i walked in 
stay away don't even think about stopping in here my stomach still hurts and i only took 2 bites of the sandwich the waiter was nice but this location is smelly gross and empty it is a shame that i didn't read the reviews before but i hope this help for future people that want to eat at this denny's 
i had called the wrong place and did not have the correct information tires plus did a great job and so did the front desk they were kind and helpful and printed out my alignment report i will be back not that i have the correct information and i received a really good quote on my tires thank you 
love the concept of this space super rad idea and theme only reason why i'm not giving 5 stars is because the lack of detail it took way long to get our beers from the bar but enjoyed the selection limited seating because the water misters made everything wet i do recommend checking this place out just don't be in a rush and if you are a large group just be ready to stand around loved the bocce and corn hole idea 
disappointed in food ordered black and bleu burger burger was luke warm and gristly only one small strip of bacon and had to ask for the bleu cheese because it was left off coleslaw tasted spoiled also ordered the joey italiano sandwich instead of giardiniera it was just jalape os this place is losing quality 
great local option for lunch breakfast and lunch is served this was my first visit and i was impressed the walls have writing all over the walls greetings and messages from previous guests make the place unique i couldn't believe i had never been here before i will return so i can try the breakfast options next time this visit i had the burger and fries i had to reorder the fries as the first time they were overcooked they offer beer and cocktails too our server ally was super pleasant and wished me a happy birthday when i arrived if you are seeking a local option with flare stop by easy access to the highway with plenty of parking 
wow not what i expected online they show a generous happy hour menu and drinks i thought it was a happening place from the web site it is not i like dive bars but this one is truely a dive all regulars inside i felt like i was intruding never offered a menu when i looked around i saw that no one had food i mean no one so i thought it better to not ask for a happy hour menu i figured i would have my one beer and scoot by the way the beautiful web site says happy hour drafts are 2 bucks i had a miller lite draft nothing fancy and she charged me 3 bucks didn't feel like arguing never coming back here again a true dive bar not the cool kind of dive bar now i need to go find somewhere to eat thanks rmac's 
this man is one happy camper have to say the craft brew scene in tampa is starting to be recognized for what it is a great start to a very promising future so imagine how happy i was to find a brewery that does not cost me a pricy uber ride to get where i need to go major kudos for that now the beer what a selection they have you can make every tastebud of every beer snob happier than a pig in s i gave all of their darks a whirl and held out till the end to try a mr anderson talk about a mind blowing experience a dark ipa what amazingly awesome makes your tastes buds sing and your brain truly question what reality you are in what a perfect marriage of flavors you like your beers dark check you want a hoppy bite check win win atmosphere is family friendly with live music and in the tradition of most craft breweries food truck dining give a spin if you are in the neighborhood 
i gave this a 3 star only because the woman that took my order and the delivery lady were very professional as well as very nice my pizza was barely lukewarm i did not like the taste of the pizza also the coke i ordered was delivered warm when i placed this order i asked if the soda was cold and was told that it was had i known it was not cold i would not have order coke with this pizza i was disappointed with the food and will not order from domino's again 
over price for the service they provide sushi was good but there is much better sushi in the city with great service they added a 25 gratuity and did not deserve that at all overall don't waste your time and money for okay food and terrible service and drinks are over priced and watered down 
this is a favorite of mine when i need to venture over the bridge to get some cheap gas located in the middle of the main street in merchantville the feeling is of a much more rural spot like doylestown this place has some of the richest and creamiest chipped beef i've ever eaten delicious food combined with friendly service make this a must on your breakfast list 
good pizza nice service a little pricey but look where you're at nice crispy thin crust pizza
i made reservations for a dinner with my uncle and aunt as well as my significant other on sunday january 8th 2017 and though it was empty perhaps it was sunday no one really dines out before work we were promptly escorted to our seats by the lovely hostess and had water right away the restaurant has gorgeous interior and artwork small yet tastefully spaced out as well as having a fully stocked bar cocktail wise i had the geisha girl which was delightful it was fruity and refreshing at the same time and though i hardly drink it wasn't strong thank goodness we had several rolls of sushi one was being the rainbow roll and yummy edamame which was not overly salty they were fresh the rest of my party at the seafood ramen which they said was yummy and it filled them right up we hardly waited for our food since there was little people in the restaurant itself and our dessert being green tea and vanilla mochi hit the right spot our waiter was a delight making sure our water was refilled and table was tidy it was a perfect way to end a sunday evening i look forward to coming back 
i was pleasantly suprised by the quality of the tapas at ceviche it was better than many of the tapas restaurants i've been to in chicago and sf we ordered about 6 plates and everything was very tasty the sangria was good but maybe a little too sweet the decor is nice and the atmosphere was pretty lively i would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for our server that was rushing us through our meal the whole evening we spent more time at the bar waiting for our table than we did eating at the table i think she was anxious to end her shift and head over to the whiskey to find her hook up for the night 
2 scoops is like 3 scoops lots of flavours definitely will come back and try a different one price was good for what u get and great service area was well kept and wet wipes were available on each table plus a washing station 
we loved this place the tacos were unreal in the depth of flavor not even considering the selection there was to choose from drinks were great as was the service one of those rare places where we felt totally welcome bringing our toddler and didn't have to sacrifice quality of the cuisine whatsoever if i lived here i'd be a regular at least a day a week 
i went to this restaurant for the first time last week and was pretty impressed service was excellent and so was the food it is a very unique menu and flavor combinations the menu apparently changes daily and is printed out in computer paper the wine list was a bit sparse but the server explained that it is a transition of wine list keeping the items fresh and changing is great but if you want to plan a meal beforehand- you're out of luck eclectic decor for sure love the chalkboard in the ladies room it was a bit noisy with the full restaurant on a friday night i recommend reservations 
i'm not sure whether this is china palace or china pavilion sign out front says china palace we went there at 1 40 on a sunday afternoon and there was no one there no one my wife was scared shitless a half full restaurant is a bad sign a completely empty chinese restaurant makes you feel you are about to be the subject of a dr moreau experiment we soldiered on though good quality food unfortunately there was the obligatory long black hair in my food what is the aversion chinese food cooks have to hair nets everything else was awesome if you are looking for chinese in sb i can't imagine much better 
hmm tough to call the layout is quite beautiful beers fun and experimental my fav is the unholy belgian trip service is fair to midland three customers after us all had the same question about the coffee variants and the guy serving never really answered the questions and had the same smart-ass answer making all of us feel sorry for having asked my feeling is that if we came all this way to learn more about your beer answer questions politely so we enjoy and purchase more btw the place was empty at the time 
food's good staff is better best of what you may expect from a locals bar fr
great view and location live music definitely a plus bbq - not what i call the best around veggies in my plate did not look fresh either wish this place had better food and i would definitely make it a favorite 
came here with my husband around 12 noon on a thurs when we got there the place was pretty empty but it quickly filled up with customers that seemed to know the owner very well that's a plus in my books means that he's willing to build a personal relationship with you we seated and right away got greeted and offered the menu the waiter recommended the horchata water let me tell you that is what you call horchata i ordered the machaca eggs with rice and beans my husband ordered the chorizo eggs with potatoes both meals come with the choice of rice and beans or potatoes everything was delicious would definitely come here again when ever we visit reno 
came here as a mother of none shopping for a friend's baby thee most helpful salesgirls ever and they worked with my incompetent lack of baby knowledge self until i found a purchase i loved - a onesie with hippos on it boom very satisfied will come back if in the area need to buy baby stuff also side note this store layout was beautiful and it kinda made me wanna have a baby so there's that anddddddd they have a big clean bathroom with a changing table and a coloring station for your spawn genius 
i had the worst experience at this restaurant the food was terrible the sauces left bad after tastes way too overpriced if you ask me management was rude when i tried to explain i was unhappy with the preparation of my food i waited 20 mins before a server came to take our order or even acknowledge us and it wasn't busy it took another 45 mins to get our good and we ordered only two dishes it is safe to say i will not be returning to this restaurant if i could give it negative stars i would 
hands-down this is the best place for fast japanese cuisine they have a limited menu but all the food is excellent my daughter swears they have the best california roll she has ever eaten personally i think it's the rice that makes it so good we have enjoyed food here for a couple of years most often we order several rolls and or ramen to-go however they do have a small seating area be aware during busy times it's impossible to get a seat also pay attention to their hours of operation since they are unusual after we order we can never leave without roaming the aisles of the attached grocery the footprint is pretty small but there are a lot of traditional japanese items to feast on of course with a pre-teen we can never leave without at least one purchase from the candy aisle s lucky for us the candy variety does not disappoint 
rolo's bakery is a small but very clean and delicious place to stop and buy delicious colombian treats pandebonos are amazing people is very kind and polite 
not really sure where to begin with this review i've been to several other blaze locations and would give them all 5 stars they run like a well-oiled machine this location is a different story to me it seems like a management problem they had 6 employees working at the same time and none of them seem to have been trained they are unorganized and the process is chaotic their communication with each other is terrible to the point that i left with a very different pizza than i intended to get because they were so disorganized that said the final product usually tastes pretty good and i like the variety of toppings if you have any kind of dietary restriction stay far away because the food prep area is a contamination disaster if you order online i just hope you weren't in the mood for anything specific because you are not going to get what you want i'll be hesitant to come again in the future 
this place is truly a gem i can't imagine anything better than a 24 hour diner bar across the street from my hotel food is good service is friendly good beer list 
produce potatoes organic chips and crackers always walk out with fresh stuff i go at least once a week love the people very nice very clean
first time here and loved it great soup and sushi great service also good atmosphere with a few tvs for sports 
i came in expecting to be greeted right away but it took 10 minutes for someone to get to the door when i got seated the food took a while and was subpar 
the only reason this review is getting two stars is because the food was decent our server erica was so rude we had to ask her for waters twice she told us we never ordered appetizers when we did every time we asked for anything she snapped or seemed bothered i get if it was a busy night but the restaurant was close to empty she never asked if we wanted another beer or glass of wine when we asked for another beer she said well i'm trying to get home and i've been here since 10 but yeah sure fine also to top off the night my shoe got stuck to gum on the floor under the table so that makes me think things aren't very sanitary 
what a great concept zpizza is a great place to just hang out or enjoy some delicious food their pizzas are cooked to perfection we have tried several items on the menu and have been satisfied with them all they really make you feel like family when you're there do yourself a favor and stop by you won't regret it 
tim was awesome everyone loved the open air photobooth there was a lot of space for group pictures and tim was able to zoom in and out to make us all fit all the guests loved it thank you for making our wedding so much more enjoyable you guys are the best 
i've never been the type of person to get waxed because i felt other places weren't clean enough or felt too girly in a typical sense anastasia changed all that the vibe is relaxed and it's a beautiful space the staff is knowledgeable and real katie changed my brow life she's straight forward and so talented kimberly is great too much love for the ass babes 
i'm so glad we decided to have an early dinner here tonight we came in right when happy hour started 4 30pm until 6 30pm happy hour offers 2-4-1 draft beer and hot sale and 4 95 house wine in addition to 3 4 5 sushi rolls and 2 sashimi we ordered a few different rolls- california roll spicy tuna roll godzilla roll philly roll shrimp tempura roll and kamikaza roll they were all very good and prepared nicely i'm so happy we found a good sushi spot close to home because there's not many within 10 minutes drive time osaka gets extra points because they're on uber eats too we'll definitely be back to osaka 
bad service horrible security people who can't use the common sense god gave them entertainment was good but never going back 
on our way from naples fl to savannah ga we stopped for dinner before the rest our long drive obviously we were trying to stay on a time schedule traveling with 2 kids we walked into the restaurant and noticed it was somewhat busy no line and empty tables were visible the hostess sat us right away we then waited about 10 minutes before someone that someone being our waitress kendra to ask us for our drink order as i looked around i noticed a 10 top table who was receiving their food a four top was seated about 10 mins after our arrival and us 4 top nothing even a beginner couldn't handle after waiting for our drinks to arrive we were ready to order at this point we had been there a good 20-25 minutes before we could even order our food we placed our order and waited to receive our food which was 2 orders of chicken tenders pulled pork sandwich a salad and soup we then waited another 25 mins to receive just that no silverware and the wrong soup i brought it to kendra's attention and she brought the manager gabby over to speak with me i told gabby that i wasn't happy about the time we had continuously waited and the service that we had been receiving she argued that i had only waited 17 minutes according to the computer and the time that our food was entered in we arrived around 8 very close to it the receipt that i have attached shows 9 36 was the time you entered my payment apparently according to gabby i can't tell time because she insisted on telling me i was wrong about my time frame and it must have just felt like a long time i'm sorry what i then told her not to worry about it because customer service obviously wasn't her strong suit upon receiving the check kendra explained that my soup was taken off because she entered it in the computer incorrectly i wasn't looking for a free meal so i was then going to still give kendra a substantial tip then i asked for her managers name and with a snarky attitude she replied would you like the number to corporate i have that too so there went her additional tip gesture i wouldn't recommend this service to anyone 
had the best wrap here in a long time and the bartender jenny was a great help and they have a nice happy hour the club level wrap is a must try
if you have ever tasted good asian food i would recommend that you skip this place freezer burned burnt egg rolls and pot stickers nothing tasted fresh nothing was special it was clean and the wait staff was nice they apologized for the food but i cannot see it getting any better 
i have not eaten in the restaurant so can't comment on the atmosphere or cleanliness we had it delivered by postmate and it was delivered while the food was still hot i agree with the other reviews that say it's a bit pricey but it's worth it since everything fresh and not cooked until you order unless you are a very big eater the little burger is plenty they have a great variety of toppings so you can have it however you like it the meat is always fresh and juicy and has great flavor again unless you are a really big eater the small order of fries is plenty too they have the best fry's when they are hot but they get greasy really quick as they start to get cold i completely disagree with the reviews that say in and out is better but i cannot stand in and out at all so it's just my opinion bummer there's no drive thru and that would probably be hard to do since they cook everything when you order it they are definitely one of the better burgers around 
what a horrible recent experience we had a warrantied battery died got a jump and got it in to replace the battery was told it was only a partial warranty a partial warranty ridiculous they seem to not even care about long term returning customers maybe they expect their car sales to be so significant that they can safely gouge service customers we will never return 
had a busy morning of sightseeing and was super hungry by the time we made it over to museum of the american revolution saw this cute little pub across the street and decided to try it they had just had a huge lunch rush it was around 1 30-2 00 when we walked in so the waitress was trying to play catch up but she was super friendly and helpful i had the chicken salad sandwich--really good the sour slaw was a perfect topper to the chicken the sweet potato fries were great too my mom had the turkey sloppy joe with sweet potato fries looked awesome and she said it was great my dad had the ham club with fries said it was delicious all of us were happy and full when we left 
best spot in tucson for any taco burrito craving my favorite are the rib tacos although everything else is soooooo good guero canelo who 
andy and freddy are great to work with drove 3 hours and bought a used nissan truck and a new car had a few bumps along the way but they worked hard to make it all better owner doug stands behind his dealership and his team and i recommend making the drive and seeing them genuine and down-to-earth service 
avoid this dump of a post office if at all possible use fedex it costs less and saves a ton of time our wasted tax dollars again and again 
other than the fact that my order 20 minutes ago was completely messed up not toasted when i asked for the bagels to be and gave me no napkins or utensils this place is good but tell me how am i supposed to put cream cheese on my cold bagels without utensils 
i have been a patient of moorestown dental professionals for roughly three years the dental hygienists are excellent as is dr rush the office is modern and comfortable and scheduling has always been convenient 
great food and entrees are excellent where this paces shines are the speciality pizzas and stuffed pizza you never know what specialty slices will be on them menu every thing from stuffed cheesesteak stallone to stuffed baked ziti or a crazy shrimp primavera slice go for the slices you won't be disappointed 
let's face it nobody goes to the airport for breakfast or the fine dining menus i don't expect much i hate writing bad reviews i try to avoid eating anywhere that i think would make me write a bad review the employees here were nasty and practically on the verge of being hateful to every single person ordering breakfast snapping at people throwing their food on the counter once it was slopped onto the plates and rolling their eyes over simple requests when multiple people in line are muttering to each other about employee attitudes there is a problem the food wasn't much better but we scarfed it down before our long flight spare yourself the time and hit up the subway next door 
ever since the transition of owners from last year to this year as dunedin locals my husband and i have noticed a significant difference in the food and atmosphere the pizza and calzones tasted authentic the sauce tasted homemade instead of bought or canned the ingredients on our supreme pizza and inside our calzones were fresh and tasty there's nothing i love more than when a pizza place uses fresh mushrooms as opposed to those yucky canned ones my granddaughter enjoyed some garlic rolls and chicken wings which have also improved immensely in flavor and sauce type since the new owners have taken over the staff was friendly and they offer a wide area for delivery would definitely recommend now a days 
avoid at all costs placed an order through a same-day delivery service these folks messed up the order and the delivery twice do yourself a favor and go anywhere else 
this is a great business model here a hand car wash is something you need to think about when you live in florida if you do a lot of interstate driving you'll have plenty of spattered love bugs to clean up love bugs the bugs which are indigenous to florida they are big enough to leave big black splat marks all over your vehicle plus you must remove them stat or your paint job is ruined very quickly jules has a 15 wash which includes both outside interior window cleaning vacuuming along with a cloth hand wash tires rim cleaning polishing all that then hand-towel-dried then they give you a choice of a few fresheners once you drive your car up drop it off pay you get your claim ticket which you'll need to get your car back there is an inside waiting room with fresh free coffee popcorn plus a large variety of vending machines with drinks snacks of all kinds divine there even is ice cream there is also an outside patio waiting area with beautiful flowers surrounding it if you don't require air conditioning would prefer to sit outside wait it took about 20 minutes for my car to be cleaned on a very busy saturday the ladies restroom was found in spotless clean condition the decor is modern the staff here are hard working care about their customers do an excellent job they even have monthly plans if that is your style definitely recommend highly 18 100
eyebrows eyebrows eyebrows go see tamara for any waxing needs i love how my eyebrows look easy to book and conveniently located near downtown free parking on the side tamara always makes me feel comfortable no matter what i'm waxing the salon is stylish with comfortable seating and coffee while you wait 
love the beehive reasonably priced and supporting a good cause everyone who works here is so nice very clean 
was there the other night they were okay i am from texas and this place is extremely overpriced and the meat has no flavor or seasoning 10 for 1 crispy taco 1 small enchilada and 1 soggy tostada it doesn't include rice or beans that you typically would get at a mexican restaurant they do give you chips and salsa but the salsa is more on the sweet side the place just recently opened and the man next to me had to try and fix the booth seat was broken and he spent probably like 10-15 mins trying to get seat in place the waiter never offered to move him the place was dead the service slow for only 2 tables and the waiter was more interested in sitting down watching the denver broncos game 
what a great setup with everything under the sun from fertilizer lawn care needs barbequeer trailers accessories plants and stuff for the yard what a great store to shop in
the lentil and yogart soup the mediterranean salad the incredible yogart dressing the doner the falafel the fresh pita -this place is incredible the staff and chef are incredibly kind as well 
i ve had the strawberry milkshake mocha and strawberries and cream here and they are pretty good will go to this place again for the strawberry milkshake
do not rent from this company my experience is similar to what others have written we booked with them because the price for the week was great after a plane ride that arrived over 2 hours late we went to get our car and learned they charge a 250 deposit we were asked if we wanted to pay 10 day for their sunpass which we declined at no time were we told that we had to avoid toll roads we planned to pay cash for the 1-2 times we would use a toll road when we tried to pay cash the toll collector told us the sunpass had paid every time we called customer service we were told something different we have not gotten our 250 deposit back although it's almost 3 months we ended up disputing the claim through our credit card and the executive rental responded that we are not entitled to the full amount due to the tolls and their charge for the tolls we told our credit card company we would accept the refund since it's over 200 but the reality is they are stealing the rest of the deposit from us and i don't believe we would see a dime if we hadn't filed a dispute with our credit card company stay away from executive car rental 
stopped here for happy hours and didn't stay for the happy hour instead we ended up doing the full bar and full entree oysters were fantastic and the drinks was amazing the downside is that the place extremely small very crowded and tight so be sure and prepare to wait 
we went to seasons 52 for dinner it was an amazing culinary experience our waiter nick was very knowledgeable and friendly the gm barbara came over to our table to introduce herself and welcome us to indy we recently moved from nyc i ordered the lump crab cake appetizer it was full of crab and very fresh and delicious i ordered the caramelized sea scallops and my partner ordered the ny strip both were cooked to perfection the mini desserts are the perfect size to end a perfect meal i highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that lives in the area or is visiting you too will have a memorable culinary experience 
i can't leave a review on the food or drinks because we never got served after sitting at a table for 18min we were visiting indy for the night and saw this place driving to our hotel as we walked there from our hotel i called just to make sure they had a table for 5 of us the man that answered the phone said yes we do come on in so we did and the host at the front was very put out we were there after i told him i just called he started to question who i talked to because it wasn't him he sat us and no one ever came so i went to the front and asked if we had a server and he said i'm working on it in a snotty tone we sat longer the manager was nice enough to recognize us by coming to our table letting us know the issue was they were understaffed we waited 10min longer still no one came and we had a show to catch so we left as we were walking out i said you can give our table to those people waiting because we are leaving the jerk behind the desk said in a super snotty way thanks have a nice day and i said seriously you smart ass and he said as he snapped his fingers in the air i'm smarter then you are honey needless to say i was pissed and we left appalled that it happened so since i can't rate the food or drinks but i would give them zero stars for their hospitality i had to give one start because it wouldn't let me post zero unreal
had krab kingzs today at the watson location food was hot and fresh and potatoes were perfect oh i forgot to mention the service was super fast i'll be back 
i went here on a recommendation from a friend who purchased his jeep here several years ago the sales agent was pleasant she was friendly and wasn't too high pressure but left room for that annoying sales exertion one of the sales managers that assisted her with locating a stock number for a wrangler clearly did not have his morning coffee as his personality was hostile and left me feeling as an inconvenience to his day his attitude and sarcastic remarks towards our sales rep made it clear that he either has a problem with her as a person or the fact that she was female his comments to her mind you in front of two customers made it seem like 'she' was incompetent and didn't know what 'she' was doing none the less i wouldn't go back there even if they could give me a steal on a wrangler and let's just say my friend and i had a little talk about his future recommendations 
god forbid on wim you decide to get your nails done here and walk in it says walk ins welcome i went to exotic nails on speedway although they were very busy they welcomed me with a smile 
i just had a great experience here it was my first time in and i just needed a yearly eye exam and updated prescription i was switching optometrists and i was a little nervous i had been with my last optometrist for 17 years scheduling was very easy when i first got there and filled out some forms they went through each cost line by line i was going to be charged for i can't even tell you how much i appreciate that so there weren't any hidden fees or questions at the end of my appointment during my appointment everyone was extremely nice i had so many questions i never could ask at my last place i was always rushed through and dr jahnke answered every single one of them she never made me feel stupid she never rushed me and she was very kind i didn't have time to look at frames that day but i will be back soon to try some on they look really cute and definitely my style also this office has a great vibe and cute decor i never felt like i was in a dated stuffy office i am actually looking forward to going back again update only gave them four stars because they will not measure or give you your pd pupillary distance unless you order glasses specifically from them so if you want to order glasses online or anywhere else really you're out of luck this is the first place i've ever seen do this 
this place has fantastic pizza i just moved to the area at the beginning of april and have tried a few pies from different places so far this is top notch 
unique theme park with construction equipment to drive and ride climbing wall and the highest rope course in the world my grandsons loved it and want to return 
food was great can't wait to try more items the menu is huge any type of mexican item you can think of they have table was dirty when we sat down but was cleaned service was sluggish the whole time but will be back 
i used to live just down the street but now i moved to westbank whenever i am in metairie i try to stop by this place for their delicious cakes the almond wedding cake is my favorite i live that they sell fresh orange juice and that they offer a large selection of assorted food desserts coffees and tea their staff always makes you feel welcomed and happily answers all your questions in a nice way 
this review discusses the manager of this specific location the company in general and the practice of repairing damaged windshields my car's windshield had a very small nick in it the nick was still small enough for the windshield to pass the pa inspection but my insurance company offered the safelite repair free of charge what could go wrong the safelite tech arrived at my home to begin the repair she immediately cracked my windshield the crack ran approximately 8-9 inches long i don't fault her these things happen i spoke with the company and the manager of the springfield office confident they would make things right and replace the windshield they had broken i was mistaken the company refused to replace the windshield although the springfield manager according to a sf company rep was authorized to replace the windshield at company cost he refused to do so i ended up having to pay 300 to have my windshield replaced sf and the springfield location were presented with a golden opportunity to satisfy a justifiably unhappy customer they both failed spectacularly i will not do business again with sf and encourage others no to as for the practice of repairing windshields with nicks its dubious at best if your car will pass inspection leave the glass alone don't run the risk of destroying it unnecessarily with this questionable repair 
robert came recommended from a friend and a neighbor extremely helpful in giving an estimate when i was in the process of buying a house spent lots of time explaining the issues with the roof and carefully showing me everything very knowledgeable not able to rate the quality of their work but the estimate was very careful - though i didn't buy the house partially because he identified problems which saved me from having to purchase a 12 000 new roof after closing i appreciated the care and time he took i plan to use his company in the future 
dr tancredi provided great care of my senior cat beany i was elated to received a follow up call the day after the appointment with reassurances on what to do if beany continued to decline the waiting area is small but it is very clean and nicely appointed the atmosphere is quiet and stress-free there's a television in the waiting area for a welcomed distraction from your ailing pet 
fantastic little place and i can't believe this was my first time trying it my husband and i had the day to ourselves and figured we'd give it a shot they had live music and i'm gonna be honest it was pretty loud and i was a smidge bothered by how we had to yell at each other but towards the end the guy singing really grew on us the waitress was super sweet and knew her stuff and when she saw my six month pregnant belly squealed about how adorable i was lol my husband ordered an omelette and the home fries with toast and i got the cheeseburger and fries both meals really good no complaints the waitress talked me into a piece of blueberry pie telling me you have to get it the baby is going to love it and she was right absolutely amazing slice of pie our grand total was a little over 23 bucks and absolutely we'll be back 
terrible business i ordered general tso chicken lunch special and requested to replace chicken with shrimp when i saw my bill i realized they added 10 extra to my order without notifying me first i asked why this happened and they said replacing chicken with shrimp makes this order dinner portion after the owner lady was done with my order she moved on to the next customer and started yelling at him about his order 
we ordered the generals chicken pork fried rice and house special chow mein everything was great a lot of local chinese restaurants taste really greasy and heavy new garden was neither of those things the fried rice and generals chicken especially had the perfect amount of seasoning and sauce my 2 year old devoured the noodles and veggies in the chow mein will definitely be ordering again 
i came in last minute needing a camper shell for my ram pickup i had procrastinated and now was under the gun the staff were amazing especially javier they were able to locate a shell that would fit and install within 2 hours even though they were busy and it was very late in the afternoon the staff took time to answer all my questions and were very friendly the best part was the manager negotiated with me i love to haggle on the price and installation all things considered i do not think 5 starts is enough if you go in be sure to ask for javier he is the best 
being from houston texas it was hard finding a real authentic tasteful and casual mexican restaurant in new orleans this joint has the best mexcian tacos in the city its a shack but that's what a real taqueria is supposed to be i definitely recommend this spot 
i cringe every time i see homewisedocs as the contact for hoa docs i am a real estate agent that has sold so many properties with hoa's i lost count the cost of this service seems to be unregulated and it allows a company to charge whatever amount they want and you can do nothing about it ordering docs and i seem to always get them on the last day they are required to be sent it is very irritating i am not sure how it can be changed recently they are becoming more streamlined so 3 stars instead of 1
dishonest lying and incompetent you must fight them over everything done wrong 1 no fixed forever here dobbs anyone warranty is 12 months 12 000 miles even some tires 2 coupons do not mean much here get the price first so they do not just up the price so it stays the same as no coupon 3 they said i needed new tires but they calverts had just put two new hifly tires on 22 months 23 914 miles ago they said the warranty was only 12 months 12 000 miles who sells tires with such a crap warranty 4 when i asked about the coupon and warranty the response was you are passed the warranty and you got the coupon price even though the checkout girl could not find it being deducted they later claimed the coupon was invalid 5 all i wanted was 2 new tires at half off for wear on the old tires and the coupon price back 6 after many talks with shop mgr and dist mgr no can do 
we brought some family from out of town here about a month ago it was busy but we were able to find a table and our food was delicious we'll definitely be back 
slow table service they totally ignored us for 15 minutes they have good beer selection and average food service is terrible at the tables so get a seat at the bar 
we love ciccio cali the hot and crunchy tuna bowl is the best but we have loved everything we have gotten here the garlic lime edamame is delicious too the staff is always super sweet and helpful the whole vibe is good there 
not as fun the place had a really bad smell everything was sticky i know you want a dive bar but this was nasty only 5 people at the bar one bartender started to ask for money to play music then she decided to skate board on the bar not a good idea in my book after that she starts to play the harlem shake now i'm from nyc and if your going to play that song you better know how to dance to it the other bartender started to yell at everyone and we decided to leave i've been to the other location and that place is fun this one was horrible don't waste your time or money on these bartenders 
great place to relax by the pool enjoy a beverage listen to some music and maybe grab a bite to eat the atmosphere is good the service can be hit or miss sometimes the food is always pretty solid the have a good sunday brunch and bloody mary bar good stuff overall a good place to have sunday funday or stop in for bite to eat 
last time i ate here i think it was a quiznos but saw the fresh ingredients sign thought maybe i got lucky not so much menu is confusing a lot going on and hard to read i ordered the special- pastrami w potato salad drink is extra my son got a baquette sandwich w pot salad and a strawberry smoothie lg total was 27 i know right the order comes and they gave me coleslaw instead of potato salad i was alright with that the staff is helpful and tried to replace it after trying it i thought i had made the wrong decision to keep it but the potato salad was as bland as the coleslaw no seasoning at all sandwiches were the same way nothing special the pastrami was watery along with the sauerkraut the sandwich was soggy my son can eat anything but was disappointed his bread was borderline burned and hard to eat and said the sandwich was bland as we waited for our food we tried to figure out the menu on the wall the only thing we decided was that it needed cleaned there are hand marks all over it another customer approached the counter and was greeted by a person out of uniform we suspect it was the owner she asked can i help you the customer asked for a glass of milk the owner said somebody will be with shortly and left the building both our table and the guy next to us thought she should have served the lady before leaving or not have asked to help her the lady had to wait awhile before another employee made themselves available to her at those prices i will not return to try again 
good deals on the happy hour drinks pretty good food for a tourist ridden city also very nice servers accommodated me with a place to charge my phone 
i thought the black drum saut ed with lemon caper butter sauce was exceptional and deliciously fresh 
had been to the one in new tampa this one has its only style but still same great quality food nice ambiance and awesome prices pretty packed since it was easter but service was still very good the maxmosa was awesome and the wine on tap is also fantastic 
so i return to bluebeard for my beloved sanctuary and good convo with friends and to find out its still the great place in the cold months as it is in the summer we ordered bread and shared a wonderful pickled beet salad followed by the delicious pappardelle pasta let me just say the pasta was so yummy - i can't even pick the words to describe not to mention they didn't prepare our pasta until we were ready for the next course bravo bluebeard i just love this place - the people the service the menu they got it all right 
very nice community space we were first to arrive at 6 00 and all the artisans were lined up along the walls lots of creative artists and the prices were embarrassing low i am familiar with big car efforts at uniting communities through the space on lafayette road and the pop up spaces around town the pop up bocce ball courts at city market this summer were nice it looked like this venue has some interesting outside spaces but the cold weather did not make it conducive to wonder around outside unlike some of the other first friday venues this location did not offer up free drinks or snacks a cash bar was available but we refrained because we wanted to check out other events we did walk over to the smaller venue 'listen hear' looking and listening but the smaller size and loudness of it all made for a quicker than usual exit i am looking forward to seeing live music at the tube and seeing creative endeavors outside this summer 
i live in san jose and visit santa barbara every year sometimes twice a year because of family and i always go to crushcakes every time the cupcakes are the best i've ever had i am not exaggerating my brother in law his wife and my husband always share a dozen cupcakes during my visits in addition i get at least 4 or more cupcakes to bring home and the drive is 6 or more hours i am on a nor-cal cupcake mission to find cupcakes just as good so that i don't have to travel so far i have tried 15 different cupcakeries just to be disappointed crushcakes is still the best i feel sorry for some people in my area because they actually believe that the cupcakes from kara's and sprinkles and other smaller businesses are good they just haven't tried crushcakes their cupcakes never fail me they are always moist the consistency of the frosting is just the right amount of thickness and the flavors are to die for the presentation is simple and eye catching at the same time and the staff are always so friendly and helpful when my brother in law comes to visit me i always try to have him bring back cupcakes because the cupcakes in my area are terrible last year for my baby shower crushcakes specially decorated them to have a jungle theme' to match my baby's room what's my favorite flavors i love the buttermilk crumb cake lemon drop crushcake red velvet coconut cloud cookies n' cream cool vanilla bean and the daily specials of strawberry lemonade and lime margarita i can't wait for my family to visit again from santa barbara for thanksgiving i have already asked for a dozen for them to bring to me kudos to the owner shannon for making the best cupcakes 
this place is wonderful right in town victorian bnb clean impeccably kept the staff was great restaurant in house fantastic food our restaurant host dave was great he got us a table at the restaurant and remembered us when we checked in genuinely concerned that we had a good experience james was great too great dinner suggestions if you come to santa barbara don't miss out on this bnb 
every time i am back in the area my wife and i always head to teresa's good food great taps selection we usually get 3 or 4 apps and a few beers each havent had any of the entrees so cant comment on them but for starters and beers this place is great 
my favorite am philly spot everything is vegan they play metal but it really is not that loud i have read many new york times articles in there with my vegan bagel and cream cheese the sun dried tomato cream cheese is the best good coffee and be aware you'll eat more than you thought you would when you see all the desserts from vegan treats on display 
we had the fried oysters appetizer followed by the bbq shrimp and the shrimp and grits dishes w loved the shrimp and grits and would come back to order it again the bbq shrimp were also great but i don't think i want to deal with the mess again dessert was the ice cream puffs excellent 
10 dollars for a bowl of lettuce - and i paid 3 dollars extra for grilled chicken i think there may have been one cube in the whole salad once again you let me down fuel
this a quaint little spot the food doesn't exactly blow you away but they still provide a solid well cooked meal with good portions and a fair price given the location i guess i just like it because it's right in the middle of everything and the staff treats you like they're your friends and not just your waiter 
went to find millie's and found out they had moved no info but found them cubby hole across the street in trail dust town famous for pinnacle peak steakhouse millie's is a breakfast lunch place open from 6 30-2 00 daily today i opted for the meat lovers omelette no bad but nothing to write home about the meat is chopped into very small less than 1 4 inch pieces and the cheese was almost nonexistent had a large tomato juice they have most justice types available including v8 mine came with a choice of toast types and choice of hash browns grits tomatoes or fresh fruit i opted for the fresh tomatoes poor choice wife had the potato pancake meal which comes with three potato pancakes and your choice of meat she chose bacon the potato pancakes were just ok and not nice and fluffy like they use to be all-in-all an ok meal due to the difficult location parking etc don't know when we will be back hope they improve
tonight my family ordered tacos we got the asada pastor and carnitas the pastor was my favorite lots of flavor and very tender my husbands favorite was the asada which was also delicious and not dry at all we will definitely be ordering from here again 
i love korean bbq and was introducing someone to the experience this was a mistaken choice i'm ok with the grease fire that had us switch tables but the service was horrible we never did get food that was asked for the dirty dishes were never cleared no one from mgmt ever stopped by to see if they could assist and there was no one around that even looked like they were in charge to talk to on the food side the banchan was mediocre consisting 4 things the ice tea came back with tea but no ice and meat was tough except the bulgolgi which was really good overall what should have been a great first experi3nce with my favorite food turned in a 50 dollar apology 
fantastic service during covid19 and incredibly friendly staff i ordered the full beer menu flight stongly recommend and a caesar salad all of the beers were great and the salad was surprisingly delicious for brewery food i look forward to going back again 
first visit here was seated quickly but at first was told there would be 10-15 wait once seated within 5 minutes we were brought water and asked if we would like anything else to drink i thought was just a pizza place so took me a while to look over the menu and decided to choose something different on the menu husband ordered pepperoni pizza and i chose the shanghai bowl husbands pizza was brought out the same time my food was however what was brought to me was not what i ordered it looked pretty though once our waitress came by i let her know that it was not what i had ordered she looked at it and said oh no it isn't she took it back and came back to table to let us know that it was her fault husband was almost done with his pizza by the time i received my food the shanghai bowl was very tasty sweet with a little tangy flavor have to admit never had anything like it definitely would order it again husband only got 2 drink refills and one was by the person who brought out the food and i only received one i was still halfway through my food and waitress brought our check but did not offer or bring me a refill unfortunately the service was not very well it was loud in there as a few times i could barely hear my husband when he was talking felt like we were in a bar but it didn't look like it 
got the chicken curry wings and beef patties food was amazing perfect amount of spice and heat in the curry and wings prices very reasonable a refreshing break from the usual 
amazing brisket everything was great and will definitely be returning the baked beans so good
rebecca has the best customer service i've seen out of every jack in the box i've been to she was fast and friendly and what's crazy is it was her first day the order took a little longer than expected so she gave me a free curly fry and didn't even know today is my birthday so that really made my day that much better thank you so much rebecca and jack in the box team you guys aren't appreciated for your time and work nearly as much as you should be 
i came here last sunday for the first time and it didn't disappoint the pizza was thin crispy and had great flavor the only little complaint i had was that it was a little too greasy but it's not that big of a deal because the pizza has great flavor the staff was nice and although it was crowded everyone was masked and distanced definitely recommend coming here 
i cannot say enough about the efficiency and customer service at bob's tire they charged me the minimum for an emergency battery replacement on friday at 4 30pm also another time the mechanic recommended a local welder to repair my car's problem rather than charge me hundreds more for a replacement they have earned my trust and that is so important to me we trust our 4 cars to them d d
these reviews need to be reset this is a great place should be 5 star seriously what other bar can a non smoker enjoy a drink or 3 and not have to smell like cigarettes all night and if you smoke they have outside seating inside is pool tables dart boards music juke and live bands and dj on select nights i went for my first time the other night and i like the crowd great group great age variation i think this is going to be our new local hang out very excited to have found this new molly malones smoke free yay 
i can see this eventually becoming my go-to for takeout greek it's located in an extremely convenient location everything i've had so far has been delicious especially the chicken pita and the quality of the food is as good as anything i've had at hella's without the half hour drive i like that their tzatki isn't dill based and has a more mild flavor and the potato salad in the greek salads is creamy and fresh the restaurant is suitable for mid sized groups and they look like they are already doing a brisk take-out biz hoping they may eventually add a fountain service right now it's just soda cans but that's ok we really needed a casual greek option in this part of dunedin so welcome 
really enjoyed sitting outside here food cauliflower with pineapple - delicious salads - they're all pretty good corn esquite - a bit on the spicier side but very good buffalo tacos - delicious vanilla ice cream - good chocolate ice cream - decent churros - ok
this is our mexican go to great staff good service and even better food mexican street tacos
i went here to look at two bikes the cb1000r honda's street fighter and a ural w side car i arrived on a clear clean title in pocket 2006 monoposto ducati 749 with 11k that i was looking to trade i'm getting older and the riding is a bit more committed for daily driving with helmet in hand and full riding gear on after several minutes of trying to explain my desire to a sales person in their defense it was a busy weekend day i was told that the cb1000r was no longer in production which was odd as this year's 2013 new pearl white model was recently reviewed in motorcyclist i assured the sales person that they were in production and asked again to confirm that maybe they just didn't have any in stock or maybe he was confusing my request with the older cb1100 i was basically told somewhat coarsely that i was not correct and that the cb1000r was a one model year that is no longer offered in the states confused i relented and later found out that i was right and was not only able to test ride one at a different regional european japanese biker dealer but also traded my ducati 749s for one i then asked were their urals are located was told that they had none in the store and it would be a few weeks before any would arrive and was dismissed very soon after that not even asked if there was another model that i might be willing to consider i can't say the sales person was flat out rude but considering that motorcycle sales have not been strong in the several years maybe this location is the exception i expected the gent to be a bit more polished in his approach and would have understand if they were not wanting to take any trades this was never voiced to me i can say the sale person was not very educated about his product and did give off a very you're wasting my time attitude despite that fact that the cb1000r is not the most popular bike in hondas lineup and the ural is somewhat of a unicorn i was surprised that they didn't have just one example on the floor or either bike it was kind of funny experiencing all the rudeness some motorcyclist attach to european specifically italian branded dealerships at this big red asian motorcycle dealer location my first and last first visit here only re-enforced my fondness for more educated customer geared european dealers i can't comment on their technical service but their sales was subpar i would look else where 
i loved the cheap beer specials and food i got the 2 drafts and wings people were having a great time 
delicious wish this place had been there when i lived in quakertown the spicy chicken sand which is to die for everything we got was really well prepared and seasoned looking forward to going back 
do you like great fried seafood check do you like mom and pop ambiance check do you like a nice glass fo sweet tea check if you think this when you are searching for a place to eat then please look no further i was first attracted to the galley when i found out that they provide the soft shell crab poboy at no jazzfest man what a perfectly fried morsel we had to try more and of course the brick-and-mortar division of the galley did not disappoint first crawfish stuffed hushpuppies with crawfish sauce top notch the sauce itself could have been an appetizer i had the fried catfish platter as my entree with homemade baked macaroni and the wife had the soft shell crab platter with sweet potato fries both dishes were home runs the catfish was not to gamey like catfish can tend to be and the macaroni was divine the soft shell crab although just a touch over-fried lived up to its billing with the sweet potato fries perfectly fried i might add rounding out the dish nicely as far as price goes its pretty decent for seafood maybe a tad bit expensive and the wait staff were kind and genuine i absolutely would recommend this place to any seafood snob or anyone else for that matter 
great place for coffee tea pastries and other goodies the staff is super friendly and it's a cool place to hang out if you can find a seat 
everytime we take our car there with an appointment simple repairs take hours there is no sense of urgency and the communication of status by the service advisor wendell is nonexistent also during this last visit a part had to be ordered and as of today 5 days later we still have not heard from them about the status or to schedule an appointment to get the repair done if i hadn't prepaid for service on this vehicle when i purchased it i would never set forth at this location again 
went in for lunch at this location yesterday first the place was filthy everyone around us was cleaning their own table my first trip to a panera pretty sure it was my last had the 10 vegetable soup and a turkey bacon avocado sandwich i wouldn't order either again the staff was friendly and that's the only reason for three stars 
really enjoy crave great lunch menu pleasant staff i just wish they'd open for dinner - even 1 night a week 
we had the worst experience using lawnmasters after we had concrete poured they came to start grading our yard in the process they scratched and chipped our new concrete in several places when the work was done and the grass mat was put down i walked around the yard there were large rocks wood pieces and large ditches making it very hard to walk i complained about this once lawnmasters came out to really see the work they agreed it was bad and said they would redo it they hired out another company to grade the yard this company took out all the drains we had put in they made the yard bigger by digging into a hill but this made the gradual hill we had very steep-not even walkable the hill is filled with rock and debris including left over straw mat lawnmasters took no claim to this hill and refuse to fix it lawnmasters did come back and replace the drains the yard still holds water which freezes in the cold this is the same problem we had when we started i do not recommend this company for any work there is a much cheaper company that would do a much better job 
beyond expectations best cuban and mojito ever tasted espresso is also exceptional wish it was closer
if you are the one person in this area or outside that hasn't tried scd do yourself a favor and try it i guarantee you won't be disappointed a lot of sandwich shops can throw a sandwich together but this place adds something that the others don't delicious flavor the salads are spectacular also 
crush is the newest hot spot in town they have great wine great food a great patio and great service the menu is reasonably priced and the portions are generous the fish is very fresh they have sushi and also oysters for a dollar on mondays i was a bit skeptical about the quality of oysters for a dollar each but they are absolutely phenomenal and well worth a try they also have very unique flatbreads and paninis that all sound and look amazing i opted for a lighter choice and enjoyed the cobb salad very much two thumbs up crush is a must try 
i have been waiting for b spot to open for months i love the chew and michael symon and the space in the iron works building is really amazing parking was pretty full since it also houses ruth chris and people live there too but we found a space and we only had a 20 minute wait they text you when your table is ready which is really cool the patio outside is huge and i bet it will be great to sit there when the weather is nicer it was quite hot today even at 6 30 i did think it was hot inside too and that's when i saw that the building is all open to the patio i was a little warm but our waitress who was helping from the cleveland location was amazing and kept our waters full they also serve pespi and had huge selection of beers and some wine i went with the gobbler and my husband got the yo i really thought about getting a salad the big blue sounded good but it's a burger place so i went with the turkey burger we also shared an order of lola fries which are seasoned with rosemary the fries were supper good and the portion was mostly big enough for 2 but i could have eaten more it was fun dipping them in the assortment of sauces including homemade ketchup i honestly wasn't that impressed with my turkey burger it was very juicy and i know from watching the show ground turkey can be hard to keep moist it just had an odd taste it was supposed to have avocado on it and i am not sure it did or i didn't notice we'd spend all day outside so being in the heat was making me tired next time i would try a different burger maybe even from the build your own options or maybe a cool salad would have been better with the hot day i just think the turkey burger at bagger daves is better my husband did like his burger and i loved the fries but at 4 you have to share due to the steep price the pickle bar is really fun there are pickles peppers and even pickled onions and green tomatoes i really enjoyed the garlic pickles and the hot and sweet pickles i would go back just for the pickles i am also glad we got shakes it was hard to decide so we got 2 the seasonal special was s'more and we got chocolate bananas marshmallows the later was my favorite it came with toasted marshmallows that was the best part they give you a huge straw and really these are big enough to share i would come back i know i want to take my aunt but i am not sure it would be a place to go all the time there are just so many burger places in town 
i think we need to change italian to russian when it comes to describing this popular russian hangout in northeast philly back in the day i must've spent at least 2-3 days a week there without being embarassed to admit it which is by far not the same as it is today in fact nothing is the same anymore expect for maybe some of the patrons the food has gotten worse the service has gotten worse the drinks have gotten a whole lot of worse if it wasn't for their availability of outside seating which is lacking in the greater northeast i'd probably give it a whopping one star but the outside seating does add something to the lacking appeal of the place in fact the outside seating does often make it the place to go for the coffee and the cakes which still managed to remain good 
it always seems to be the unassuming mallstrip mexican joints that fare the best in cuisine i first judge the quality of a mexican restaurant by the complimentary chips and salsa set out immediately as you are sat which is really the best thing about mexican and italian restaurants alike immediate food however the chips and salsa here weren't the best i've ever had good but not the best the salsa was mild and didn't really have anything special going on chips were homemade and crispy but again not outstanding here is where the outstanding comes in and my second judging point at any new mexican restaurant i try pescado tacos la terraza's offers baked or fried tilapia having a choice in this matter is to my pleasure - anywhere i can shave off a few calories makes me a happy diner the tacos arrived on a large plate three of them along with a heaping mound of special seafood rice the rice was not typical mexican rice - it was dotted with peas and little carrots and had been saut ed in a delicious light oil much like chinese friend rice it complimented the fish tacos perfectly the baked tilapia was cradled in a choice of corn or flour tortilla i chose corn and topped with fresh tomatoes onion and lettuce for the record the seasonings on the fish itself were absolutely fantastic the tacos also come with cheese which i opted out of i don't like anything ruining the fresh delicate flavors of my fish tacos especially cheese i squeezed fresh lime over all and i was absolutely in fish taco heaven service was very friendly and prompt -- our waitress had a great smile the atmosphere was nothing special very typical of a generic mexican restaurant but the food is authentic and not run of the mill be prepared to leave satisfied and stuffed 
i'll admit i was both skeptical and excited when my friends announced a few months back that they had heard of this place and wanted to check it out a trailer converted into a dive bar run by a man who looks like santa it sounded interesting and oh how interesting it was - and still is i'm not usually a fan of smoky dive bars i don't like the smell however this place was so awesome i had to make an exception and simply accept that i'd desperately want a bath post visit the place is two converted double-wide trailers decorated like christmas year-round - there's even a fancy graffiti-style christmas mural airbrushed on the front of the pub very festive the servers here are super friendly and i've even heard that santa himself will buy you your first beer should you show up your first time and not know the place is cash only also unlike the clientele i've seen in similar bars the patrons are often in their 20's and 30's and seem to have all of their teeth karaoke is the highlight of my santa's experiences although there is also a pool table in the back should you want to find another form of entertainment you'd be surprised the kind of folks who can go up there and blow you away with their talents occasionally the servers themselves and the man operating the karaoke will also serenade the patrons it always makes for a good time lastly don't come hungry as they don't serve food they do however serve 2 beers here so definitely come thirsty 
the best bbq i've had in stl thus far the brisket was tender juicy and melted in my mouth the ribs were out of the sight the baked beans potato salad and sweet potato fries were great i enjoyed the sweet bbq sauce for sure the staff were very kind and welcoming this is the place i would bring all of friends when they come to visit to get a proper taste of stl for sure 
patricia is wonderful and so are her treatments i've done a number of things including facials and acupuncture and every experience has made noticeable improvements i would definitely recommend patricia to anyone who is looking for a noticeable improvement in their skin as well as overall health 
went there last night they ran out of a lot of food the food we did have was spectacular fried chicken is so good no need fir the dipping sauce that comes with the service was on point juan did his best to point is in a direction given the limited menu at that moment drinks were awesome as well we will be back so much to try 
great place for cheap drinks and a cool hole in the wall bar like i'm use to from back home my 3 star ratting is based on the unpredictable cover charge often times while having a drink at the bar someone comes around and informs you it will be 5 to 20 to remain inside for the jazz band that's coming up it would be nice if they just put up a hand written sign with the time and amount the cover will be so you don't have that awkward encounter of pay me or leave 
the steaks were excellent duh but the atmosphere was a bit noisy and busy i'm thinking that a steak restaurant with that quality of steak and prices has a more relaxed atmosphere with better acoustics everything was open so all the sound of everyone talking and the cooks cooking and the bartenders working was all around you our server was excellent just not a fan of the atmosphere it should only get 3 stars because of that but the food and service was too good 
i love this place it's so cute and all the staff is very friendly the food was amazing huge portions to go around i also recommend the hot chocolate it has to be made with love because wow completely and totally recommend this to everyone 
revelations has been around for many years which shows the salon is successful itself i came to revelations in 2001 when i was a freshman in high school to get my hair done for prom at manogue i have quite the history with revelations i find revelations to be a great place to get your hair done my biggest rave for revelations is my new hair stylist taryn i met taryn after i purchased a groupon about four months ago i was looking for a new hair stylist after having several horrible experiences prior to finding taryn she has been on-time every time i come to the salon she is full of personality and a great conversationalist taryn has fair prices for her services she is a great person to get to know you will be entertained from the time you sit in her chair until the moment you leave so ditch the magazine 
i am in love with this office from the office staff to the doctor dr hall is amazing and creates miracles he has an amazing staff to make sure you don't get lost in the paperwork shuffle everything is organized well communicated and with clear expectations i would do this all over again with my son so a huge heartfelt thank you to dr hall land staff so much love
this place is so bombbbbb you look at the menu and think two tacos for 14 is expensive which yeah it kinda is but their tacos are huuuge they were so filling and so delicious and they do not jip you on the meat the carne asada was so delicious and not dry all its different in that the meat is like cut up steak rather than the kind of meat you see at food trucks it also comes with your choice of black or pinto beans in a crispy tortilla cup and mexican rice on the side i thought i'd still be hungry after this but i couldnt even finish my plate at least the beans portion they also have a selection of drinks and beers to choose from the horchata was very good not too sweet and not too cinnamon-y theres also a bar for limes sauces cilantro onion salsa etc at your disposal the meal also comes with complimentary chips while you wait for your real meal to roll through you order first then hopefully you can find a table right after ordering as this place is sometimes super packed but definitely worth it 
much better than expected pros the people every single person working there that we interacted with was welcoming and friendly dave at the front desk was awesome and daily- went above and beyond to help us and answer every question including recommendations on where to eat and which tours to take the hotel and our room were clean i've read a bunch of reviews saying otherwise but our experience was a nice clean room that was nicely decorated the bed was comfy the bathroom was huge and we were in a quiet location walking distance to everything and yet not in the middle of it all this was especially nice at night when walking to the store on the corner might have been sketchy in the french quarter cons in room 602- light comes in from around the door also the blackout drapes were great at night but i had to rig them closed so that the morning light didn't blind me when it came peeking through the sides and reflected in the mirror right in front of the bed our room was small and pretty cramped we stayed 5 nights and had 2 big suitcases also my husband has a scooter it was tight in there breakfast was just ok i'm not a big breakfast person but i would've liked the muffins danishes warm they did have eggs bacon sausage and omelets also pancakes real fruit and juices overall i would absolutely stay here again the things that were good were really really good i felt safe it was comfy and clean and mostly the people were exceptionally friendly 
stayed here for a four night stay through stayalfred and we were amazed this is definitely a place where you can judge a book by its cover from the exquisite exterior to the modern yet quaint interior with exposed brick walls tasteful art and fine furnishings the two bedroom apartment we stayed in surpassed our expectations soaring ceilings a large galley kitchen with washer and dryer at the end a master bedroom with large on-suite the second bedroom with a crazy huge walk-in closet and more the common area was well kept and stocked with board games and books cable tv and grand piano there was a gym as well but we never utilized it so i can't comment on it staff at the front desk were friendly rarely did i hear any noise in the hallway best of all the location can't be beat i highly recommend a stay here 
the bagel joint locally owned and operated great tasting bagels cooked to perfection very tasty and fresh 
food was absolutely phenomenal which kept me from rating this establishment as a 3 for such slow service the waiter was friendly but we had to ask for our white wine bottle to be chilled and the time we had to wait to order and for our food was on a level of high frustration im glad i tried this restaurant and would come back we came on a tuesday and expected much better service for such a low key evening again the food was great i had the alaskan halibut which was amazing my pals had the red fish and catfish platter all meals were thoroughly enjoyed 
if slow service and cigarette smoke in your face is for you then this is your kind of place how's the song go i got friends in low places i'll pass 
i went in to buy a vehicle today i'm going to try to make this quick because a lot of things happened -i got offered 4k less than an other dealership in st louis plaza infiniti for my trade-in -no effort was made to come up on my trade in -no effort was made to come down on the sale price of the vehicle i chose we hadn't even started negotiating the price they had was already sooo good that they could come down on it -the lease special that was listed on the vw website wasn't honored at the dealership -thier military discount was rolled in to the price of the car the same price already on their website everyone gets that discount then -sales associate rolled his head when i stated my discontent with the figures he presented -the sales manager didn't want to approach my wife and i because we were escalated customers isn't that your job -sales manager calls back only after i send in an email to their reviews inbox and pretty much tells me that they won't come up on my trade in or come down on their price -- so nothing changed just called to console me but not to take a firm stand and say hey i'm here to help you come on in and let me make you a deal you'll feel good about nope didn't get that at all long story short didn't buy a car from them because they really didn't want to sell a car i suppose so i'll go somewhere else that'll make an honest effort at working a deal with me without jerking me around you know because that's all i wanted at the end of the day 
don't leave new orleans without visiting the voodoo museum i will not be disappointed 
i first heard of sweet p's while i was in laguna beach and read an article by the owner in an orange county magazine i brought the magazine back home to abu dhabi in the u a e and wanted a gift from sweet p's sent to my mother for her birthday i ordered the complete facial care set from their website and they delivered it in 2 days just in time from her birthday not only was it everything my mother wanted they sent me a discount card for my next order i ordered some prickly pear sunscreen and foot cream for myself after my mother was so happy with her facial set my feet were completely smooth after only a couple nights of using it i wear sandals all the time and my feet get dried out in the california sun and the foot cream from sweet p's is one of the best products i've ever used skincare or otherwise sweet p's is one of those rare companies that actually deliver a product that they advertise not to mention how inexpensive everything was in my country and in my local san diego hair salon the same skincare products would be 5 times as much i have to say this is the first and only time i've ever spent the time to review a product or company i have since bought all my sisters gifts from sweet p's and they are all so happy with their gifts thank you sweet p's 
parking is a bit tight mainly because they are always busy however they do work fast to get your food out it is a hole in the wall the food is amazing the customer services is different they treat their customer like family and the regular customers treat them the same way too lots of shit talking right when you come in so don't be alarm i haven't order anything that i did not like they will stuff as much as they can in your box or poboy you will get a lot of food the price is cheap too recommendations roast beef poboy it get wet get it with the cajun fries or gravey fries the chicken wings are huge get it with pasta on friday only they don't serve it on any other day the gumbo or the yagama it usually get really busy so i recommend you calling in your order 
it's a community staple this gem is located in a strip mall anchored by a grocery store big box supply chain it's an established carry-out with 10-12 tables if you choose to dine-in i wish more businesses in the area would take their time engage their customer base like the owner her son the friendly staff make a concerted effort to do every day that they're opened the lunch dinner specials are tasty fulfilling made to order with special vegan dietary request available if you ask i always leave with a second order to pick up when another friend family finds out that i'm grabbing lunch or dinner go out of your way to dine here you will leave with a new found outlook on stl chop suey 
happened to notice this on postmates and remembered reading it had opened so i figured i'd order it the menu seemed small but there were several appealing options i ordered the italian and a side of the spinach mac seemed a tad pricey for the portion size but i was pleased with how thoughtfully the sandwich was composed and the high quality ingredients and flavors the bread was perfectly proportionate with the meats and cheeses and all were perfectly toasted it was a delightfully flavorful sandwich i would have liked the option to add some veggies though but the as-is version was delicious the spinach noodles in the mac cheese were also delicious the cheese sauce was basic and could use a little flavor but it was a nice accompaniment to the sandwich all in all a delicious sandwich though just a tad pricey and i'll probably order again somewhat soon 
horrible service made an appointment then the groomer took someone with 4 dogs ahead of me when i asked about my appointment naty freaked-out and started yelling like a lunatic in-front of other customers owner david oser is clueless has not been in the store probably since it opened let's his hourly employees run the place badly never again stay away your time and money is better spent elsewhere 
went there on a wednesday night not crowded at all waited 45 minutes for food people ordering take out we're getting food faster no way anyone should wait that long when only three tables taken in the dining area on top of it while we waited for our order some of our food was clearly done earlier and sat under the heat lamp they turned chicken fingers into rawhide and dried out the toll on a cheese steak we had family from out of town with us and we all left disappointed they took a little off the bill but that does not fix a really bad experience i would never recommend this restaurant to anyone 
if you want to spend more than 400 for a group meal and have miserable service and have the added pleasure of a truly uncomfortable setting then the olde bar is for you the seating is abysmal if you are not lucky enough to get one of the few booths that line the walls you will then be relegated to the 'high top' tables and chairs that line the center of the room the tables and very uncomfortable chairs are not level so if your table is not rocking your chair sure is and you have the unwanted sensation throughout your meal as if one were eating on a rough sea the service was truly bad our glum server forget her name handed us an extensive cocktail menu and quickly returned multiple times asking us if we were ready to order before all of us even had the chance to look at the offerings if she initially returned too quickly hawking us all for our drinks then she barely showed up and neglected us during the meal orders for refill drinks at a time when it was not busy went past fifteen minutes and one of our diners was going to go directly to the bar to get them there was no salt and pepper or plates on the table so one of my companions had to go to empty tables that were already set up and remove the condiments plates and utensils the seafood tower was delicious but four entrees that we ordered all came out separately and several minutes apart the steak oscar was beautifully tender but for flavor only passable bottom line the olde bar has profoundly uncomfortable seating combined with truly abysmal glum service and food that i would rate as 'meh' if you want a pleasurable meal in a lovely place then spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere 
great little cafe on the corner food was home cooked with fresh ingredients highly recommend 
inconsistent and a little over-priced friendly service superb butterscotch pecan scones and good thai iced coffee which is my fav depending on who makes it i finally got a seat on the couch the other day with my lady only to be stared at by an older middle-aged woman and her husband for about a half hour to sum it up good but inconsistent and pricey 
came here for a conference meeting and i must say the customer service the time of waiting and everything above was incredible from the food which by the way was amazing man the deserts are to get hooked on i must say you pay for what you g et and its worth it 
used to be my favorite coffee joint in all of nashville not anymore the decor our bland and the drink selection is sparse and boring i was really sad to see that with all of the new additions to the facility all of the old flavors and charm were thrown away 
neat vibe inside defiently sets a tone of classy time capsules bar unique menu with interesting combos of flavors we had the old fashion - balanced and not too strong tangerine gimlet - tastes exactly what's in it rosemary at first sip smell then combo of smooth citrus with finish of smoky very unique also had a regular gimlet which compared to their specialty was equally well balanced and smooth done with their gin the bar tender seemed a little odd and forgetful but he was friendly none the less if he had been more talkative engaging and interactive in ordering and also not forgetful in what drink he had poured for which person or who he had charged for what there were only 6 of us and the only ones at the bar i would probably would have rated a 5 
struggling to find a local spot that carries the sunday nfl ticket i was referred to halligan's if i'm going out alone drinking and yelling at 1pm on sunday this is where i want to be from now on great staff and clientele pretty much a bunch of local dudes out watching some football and talking sports the bartender is happy to put the patriots game on a tv for me even though i'm the only one in there to watch it i haven't sampled enough of their menu to comment on their grub but they have a well-rounded beer selection 
the idea of a restaurant that focuses on calorie count and ambience while throwing in great taste is very intriguing i went to seasons 52 for dinner at keystone during their 4-6 30pm happy hour and i must say it was superb free valet parking dark wood and stone modern decor--an overall cozy feel most people are dressed up here very nice servers food was out within 10 min and reasonable prices got a plate with 3 asian wings 290 cal for 5 and a spicy salami flatbread for 10 the wings--wow tender chicken and sweet spicy sauce with a real kick flatbread was full of flavor 470 cal 10 from the crispy crust to the sweet tomato and the mozzarella cheese it's hard not to resist ordering more food but i did it the verdict it's right around the borderline upscale range but a definite must try either way as a person who constantly eats out this is better for health as well i will be back 
i sent this company my samsung note 4 that is in pristine condition it was always in a cover and had a screen protector it was like brand new they advertise that they will give you up to 265 dollars for it online they only want to give me 19 bucks for it absolutely do not trust this business 
we've tried a bunch of chinese take out in the city and this has become our go to the food is always hot and tastes fresh my hubby loves the egg rolls and the veggie dumplings are my go to fave i always order and pick up so i can't comment on the delivery aspect of this business however every time i arrive my food is ready and waiting 
wow these guys are awesome greatest arcade in tennessee no contest even sold me arcade parts very helpful will be going back 
the online ordering was probably the best ides we had it was a great experience it was not only easy but quick when i got to the restaurant to pick up my order the woman at the togo order section was so friendly and courteous she was also very helpful then there was the food it was not only delicious but was plentiful i was able to make at least three meals out of one order this is by far the best experience i have ever had from a restaurant i would definitely recommend this place to everyone i know please keep up the great work 
absolutely has turned to crap closed for bugs rooftop bar in need of cleaning and updates sorry falkensteins so bad now
i have lived in meadowlawn for 27 years and this restaurant is by far the best italian food i have ever had thanks for being in my back yard 
the hotel is very well decorated and within walking distance to everything great in downtown santa barbara we had two different rooms during our stay room 101 had two queen beds and absolutely no useful functionality it had no cabinets or useful areas to store your belongings the room was small however the beds and pillows were very comfortable room 206 was our second room this room was larger and overlooked the pool it had shelves and cabinets built in to the area around the bed there were two murphy beds in the room which came in handy with out two children it's clear the hotel spent more money on the decorating than functionality of the rooms one of the room had a mildew smell and wet carpet under the air conditioner the staff was wonderful vincent took our initial reservation and worked very hard to ensure we were taken care of he provided a good rate and made us feel comfortable roger helped us when we had an issue with a mildew smell in the room he wanted to switch our room but there was no other vacancies we elected to stay the night in the room and he graciously provided a discount at checkout and a discount coupon for a future stay the location made it a great option for future vacations we gave it a 4 star rating because of the location cleanliness except for the wet carpet and minor mildew smell on the one night staff professionalism pool and trendy design 
great food homey vibe the owners are really lovely worth the wait 
chill bar with a great beer selection i had a fantastic spicy bloody mary the bartenders were pretty cool and attentive conversating with patrons we stopped in on a rainy saturday afternoon so the place was kind of quiet 
my vacation girls and i went to this restaurant the food was sub par but kris and i enjoyed the margaritas this was lana she didn't care for the food kris and i thought it was good 
good ol' yelp helped introduce me to uph i went for the junior league of tucson's a winter night's dream at st philip's plaza while checking out the event and the new stores i walked into union the first thing that hit me was the smell of their beautiful christmas tree secondly i was impressed by their renovations and how open the place is chris told me a bit about the place and was nice enough to give me a menu to go after these impressions i decided to have my birthday dinner here i made sure to make a reservation since it was for a saturday and i've heard that it can get really busy they set us up with an awesome table and even accommodated us by adding an extra table when we had more people than we thought come i had the cu ball drink- and though it was yummy- i wish it had more drink-a smaller ball of ice- but it's a cool looking drink everyone loved their food the crispy pork belly flatbreads and the chicken and waffles to name a few i decided on the short rib potstickers which is a variation i had never had and i loved them the potstickers along with other fabulous options were on their social happy hour menu which is even on the weekends our waitress michelle was amazing and chris didn't get to meet grant yet was awesome i'm definitely going back whether it's to try different items for dinner or to meet someone there for social hour great food and atmosphere 
staff was nice and their veggie burger is surprisingly good but they don't have all the salad dressings represented on the menu bathrooms were clean 
amazing the sausage is as good as it gets and the roast beef hash is amazing good coffee and pleasant service the only thing they could improve is to make their own jelly or marmalade 
grab yourself a few of these delicious soft tacos and you're good to go i like the veggie best there are also pints which are like a larger taco without the shell and don't forget dessert their sopapilla cheesecake is the bomb 
one of the best dusty used bookstores anywhere in or out of new orleans we stop here whenever we are in town the selection is always interesting and russell the owner knows his vast collection better than i know my own house the foreign language section is particularly interesting and this store is one of the few places where you can find books in or about cajun french whatever you're looking for he can tell you where to find it or suggest things you might like the books are piled high and close together so move carefully exploring this place feels like an expedition more than shopping i never know what i will find but i always go home with an armful of treasure 
such a gem tucked away in a small neighbourhood amazing coffees teas great food menu cute decor multiple rooms with unique ambiance outdoor patio and they grow their own herbs the first thing i ever ate at little brick was the mushroom salad it is actually more then a salad it has noodles a great selection of mushrooms microgreens nuts and dressing it's filling and fulfilling in flavor and volume i've also had some of their muffins and a soup everything was tasty little brick has only been around for a short time but they have already ingrained themselves into the community and it feels like they've been there forever the community has embraced them and vice versa 
if you need a video and somehow still have a dvd player that is collecting dust then by all means this place is for you the titles are new to old great prices and nice to roam the isles to read the actual boxes again 
this is hands down the best meal i have ever had the pleasure of eating in my entire life there is a reason why chef john besh is so esteemed the amuse-bouche to begin the meal was decadent it had a parmesan custard caramelized onion mousse and parmesan crumbs the creaminess of the mousse and the rich flavor was incredible next i had a salad with bruleed goat cheese rhubarb and strawberries this was light and tart and creamy all at the same time beautiful and delicious then came the main course potato gnocchi with blue crab and black truffles it was perfectly proportioned and amazingly rich this instantly became a comfort food for me for dessert i ordered a buttermilk chocolate cake with peanut butter pretzel mouse pretzel icecream and bits of chocolate covered pretzels if i could have licked the plate i would have as of the food wasn't enough to make you absolutely want to eat here their service was also great do yourself a favor and come eat here right away 
i am definitely a fan of syberg's this location is close to where i live which makes it so convenient for us to grab lunch or dinner there whenever we want this past weekend we were out running errands and on our way home decided to eat out instead of eating thanksgiving leftovers again and we both agreed on syberg's when we arrived the parking lot was pretty full but we managed to find something we walked in through the back door and found our way towards the hostess stand there was a table for 2 available so she asked if we were okay sitting there and of course we were our server mariah came over to greet us and was so pleasant we ordered some drinks and she even asked if we wanted water as well which we did when mariah came back i made a comment about how the menu's were new and she was totally as excited as i was about them the menu is pretty much the same with maybe a few new items but the menu itself was newly printed and it looked great when it was time to order i knew i wanted to order the fitzgerald chicken they can sub swiss if you aren't a provel fan which is what i usually do since that is my go to item i usually get the sandwich but this time i ordered the dinner since i wanted to have a dinner salad and a side of fries she was helpful with my choosing my side items and even listed off the dressings to choose from my hubby ordered the taco salad which came on a huge taco shell while we were waiting for our food mariah came over a few times to make sure we knew that our food would be out soon she was pretty busy but it was nice that she had time to keep up updated eventually my salad came out and then a few moments later our food came i wasn't too hungry that night but i did manage to eat my salad a few bites of the chicken it was exactly what i needed my hubby finished his meal and mariah came over to offer dessert but we declined she gave us our check and even asked if we had the syberg's app which i do it's a nice way to track spending and even get some money off your bill once you earn enough points we go often enough so that this is a good perk for us i asked for a to go box which she brought over quickly when we were walking out mariah quickly found us and brought me my to go box since i had left it at the table how thoughtful i really did forget about it so i am glad she was able to find us since i really was looking forward to eating the leftovers overall syberg's is a great neighborhood spot with some tasty food and fun servers i really enjoyed mariah's personality that night i wish i could get her every time if you go definitely ask for her 
been here 4 times since they opened for breakfast lunch dinner dessert their staff is very friendly and welcoming sometimes wait times are long so just know that before you go their breakfast is definitely better than some other popular chains and portions are giant besides their breakfast their tri tip dip is also very good and their desserts are divine would definitely recommend 
we found this spot while walking by the park sits right on the marina we didn't have a reservation but they seated the 5 of us immediately we ordered a bunch of appetizers that all came out quickly the lobster bisque was really good friendly staff great location 
wowowwoow my new favorite place to eat i don't even know where to start we started off with the dinner for 2 which included 6 steaks 4 different kinds of steaks and 2 sides our food came out in less than 10 minutes all hot savory juicy and just all kinds of perfection my favorite was the skirt steak the flank steak i will be dreaming of this steak when i'm hungry at work for dessert we ordered the caramel cannoli which was out of this world for everything we ordered the bill came out very fairly priced and we are 99 satisfied the only thing i was a tad upset about was that i asked our server is bread came with our meal and he said yes but on the bill it was 1 extra other than that we are sooooooo full and soooo satisfied we will be back 
amazing coffee great customer service just around the corner from my house and work i just keep missing all the sweet baked goods
this place is completely gross not clean and it smells like piss in the hallway and why am i forced to click on a star updated do not stay here we had someone knock on our door at midnight come to find out they do this so you open the door and rob you this place is terrifying and i will be writing to the ceo
best fucking rite aid out they have a parking lot which is perfect for stopping in at the wine and spirits that's across the street also they have medicine stuff just to keep it 100 their cold drink selection is beyond lacking 
they don't take temporary id's here even if they are government issued ids will be going somewhere else from now on for drinks 
let's talk real barbeque and they have it brisket all around my table people we're ordering ribs and other 2nd bests have the brisket i had an order of sweet potato fries and coleslaw in elgin texas and kansas city both gamed for barbeque brisket reigns goodwood's stand up to that quality
not sure about the staffing issues but the food was ok for breakfast waits are long tables open but not enough staff on a sunday morning 
stick a fork in it we live a block away from restaurant been there at least 30 times plus tonight my daughter was in town so we decided to walk up because her friend was in town from washington state and was in to healthy food ordered my usual crunchy tuna bowl wt kale never disappoints my wife the chicken marsala pizza also a favorite while we were all eating a roach comes across the floor by my wife's leg i'm from florida so not great but been there many times that's what you get living in florida it goes to corner near our table and slips in crack our daughters friend freaks out a little and we tell him not a big deal its a florida thing then a few minutes later coming down the chair molding is a inch and a half inch roach onto our table we all kind of freak and move to another table they call a guy from the back who crushes roach in napkin and takes him to the back again we are not going crazy because we grew up in florida the guy came back who grabbed the roach and asked if we wanted a comp desert i was like no our appetite was not that great at that time he shrugged and they brought the bill it had everything on it we ordered not even a drink comp this was our go to restaurant in neighborhood when we wanted healthy i guess everything comes to a end sometime 
champ's diner reminds me of comfort food that you crave on a tuesday summer afternoon abby and zummy my server were awesome this is probably one of the rarest severs who i have seen who actually enjoy their job the diner is small with chalk writing so it gives off a casual vibe i order the chicken and waffle and it was great the portion size was extremely filling the chicken was seasoned extremely well like your mom was in the kitchen cooking for you there was a sweet chili sauce for the chicken which went well the chef for this particular dish did fantastic i also tried from my friends the eggs which were good sweet potatoes fries which are a staple for me and they were great i would 100 be visiting again if you go ask for abby and zummy 
drinks are okay but very bad services the bartenders are very lazy rude and unfriendly there was a long line but the bartenders just stood aside and pretended not seeing the line a lady walked toward them and ask for services the bartenders scolded and asked her staying away after 15 minutes waited in line i finally was able to order my drink i wanted two but the bartender only have me one and said one drink per customer after i paid and the drink was ready the bartender asked for extra tips before handing over the drink that's the most ridiculous experience i ever got from a public bar highly not recommend 
this is our most favorite steak house in stl the service is prompt there is a team of wait staff to help with all your needs constantly checking on you we normally order the filet baked potato creamed spinach-etc the steak is seasoned so well it's absolutely delicious we have been there about 15 times and each has been consistent i recommend checking it out 
the beignets were good but the girl who rang us up and helped us was totally rude not sure if she hates life or just herself otherwise i would've gave it more stars she had a bad attitude and kept slamming everything down on the counter in front of us including our change boooo won't be stopping by there again oh and the coffee was lukewarm
visiting tampa and after my first meal choice of the impossible philly i am now been unable to eat anything else it's a blessing that i discovered this sandwich but also a curse i love that they are more creative with the impossible burger they flat pressed the onions peppers meat on a deli grill and let all the flavors marinade to die for flavor they have casseroles with the impossible burger to take bake and the deli counter has all the side salads for your sandwich i poked around the grocery store and they have some great options like loma linda brands even local beers the kombuchas were a but pricey but i don't know if this is a standard for the area one thing i found to be interesting was there are no recycling bins very limited on the streets as well definitely recommend the philly is you're looking for something filling and flavorful
i started with the dragon gym as a 6 year old child in 1986 being ambidextrous i struggled with coordination not having a dominant side at the time the karate kid was popular and my parents had a coupon to the dragon gym they figured at the least two weeks free training and a uniform would be a neat experience for the next 14 years the dragon gym transformed me into a disciplined healthy and focused individual and helped lay the foundation for spiritual growth and introspection it's so much more than an activity it's a way of life the current head master somnath sikdar and his partner master lonnie beck came up with me through the ranks after a 20 year absence from the area i've returned to find that the current iteration of the gym has maintained what makes the dragon gym special while adding different arts and programs and putting great effort into tailoring progression to fit a child's intellectual physical and psychological development to sum it up there's nothing like the integration of body mind and spirit coupled with the ability to focus and overcome challenges in your life i cannot think of a better extracurricular practice for a child to grow into and be prepared for adulthood than becoming part of the dragon gym family 
i absolutely love this restaurant the sushi is always fresh tasty and presented in a beautiful way the chef staff are wonderful a must try if your in the area 
as usual this place never ever disappoints us the atmosphere is spectacular the service is top notch and the food is always excellent 
we have been multiple times hoping for a good experience but each time was worse than the previous terrible customer service terrible management and terrible food if it actually does come out correctly we will not be back unless they come under new ownership 
panzorattis are always good but how could you mess up something frozen i called and asked for a ten count of garlic parm wings i got 10 dry wings with minced garlic all over them very displeased with that 
completely overpriced really underwhelming food cheesesteak was 80 roll and very little meat a sandwich comes with under-salted chips if you want a side salad that will take your 13 cheesesteak up to 18 also ordered the southwestern cobb salad dressing was cloyingly sweet mix of ranch and barbecue sauce largely just romaine and a handful of toppings for 15 i would not be as disappointed in the food if it weren't so overpriced will not go again 
i usually get good food at fortels but had issues this time pizza had little taste except for the pepperoni the mushroom appetizers were inedible all wet and mushy on the inside and no way it was made with fresh mushrooms it was carryout so no server to complain or take back not if we will go back for awhile 
i came here with my best friend to get dip nails for her upcoming vacation hannah did my dip nails and what was usually a 45 min service took over an hour and a half this was clearly her first time doing this as she had an older lady check them and say eh okay at the end they charged me 40 for an uneven unfinished unfiled mess of a manicure i had to go get them removed and then fixed at my normal salon never ever going back 
i had a pleasant shopping experience several weeks ago i was served by a young man named armand he is prompt efficient professional and i see great things in his future he provided me with excellent service it was exquisite and superb i hope that the corporate office sees this and gives him a promotion in management along with a substantial pay increase i wish every other employee at this location was as professional
great meal with my wife from beginning to end everything was perfect i had the flounder pontchartrain and she had the hanger steak 
great spot good portions and fantastic flavors we ordered a bit of everything and nothing disappointed and the employees are incredible so the service was top-notch and it's a byo we will definitely be returning 
after a day of sightseeing around tucson we stopped at nimbus for dinner the five of us all enjoyed our dining experience three of the group had the chicken and pear salad very good and one had the western burger which he said was excellent his side was the sweet potato fries i had the beef stroganoff flatbread it was very good tasting just like the pasta dish that i have had previously the sirloin was tender service was very good would definitely return 
estimate for 1400 for blower motor and exhaust motor exhaust motor was tested by a separate company and tested fine very upset at a dishonest repair man looking to get money for something that was never broken would not recommend 
so unimpressed my husband saw this place on open table and said the reviews were 4 5 5 we are people that like to find out for ourselves the service was great but the food was unexceptional we got the special salad which was fair in flavor the bread served with olive oil was plain and flavorless the pork tenderloin wasn't tender at all but it had a nice flavor and the mashed potatoes that came with it tasted like instant potatoes and were also flavorless save your money 27 was outrageous to me for the portion size and flavor texture and that's coming from someone that's paid upwards of 70 for a good steak in the city it just was not good the homemade pasta was tasty but the sauce left me wanting more it lacked the spice it claimed to have the meatballs we ordered on the side tasted frozen and didn't have enough enough flavor the only reason i'm giving this place two stars is because the dessert was great chocolate cake with vanilla gelato and strawberry coulis was delicious and the service was good ginger was an excellent server i also loved the chairs although our table was wobbly ginger did bring a shim to fixed that issue so again great job to her i won't be back 
this is a great vet in a convenient location with extended hours we have been bringing our two kitties there for checkups and other issues since they opened each time the staff members have been super helpful and the vet has provided the treatment or advice we needed 
this is a fun idea for a wine bar lots of wines to taste and you have your choice of a 'taste' a 'half-glass' or a 'full-glass' obviously the price per glass varies with the amount served i have to say that the 'taste' is miniscule for the price so i would go for the half-glass every time you order your food at the counter and it is delivered eventually because we were a group each person ordered separately but the service was very hap-hazard some dishes came out in a different order than when placed guess they took a shorter time to cook most of the food was quite tasty but everyone who had fries said they were just room-temperature certainly not hot and one of the dishes served crab cakes were still cold in the middle not good now for the challenge of the place you exchange your credit card for a plastic card that you use for all your purchases of food and wine it's a great idea but i personally tried two wines that were from almost empty bottles although they refilled them i asked if i would be charged for the little drop from the empty bottle i was assured that i would not be charged i asked for a copy of the itemized receipt and was told that it would take a half hour to get that what seems like potential for rip-off to me the next day i looked at my bill i paid 35 34 for a main course at 15 00 and the two half glasses of wine that i had hmmm the half glasses were 5 and 6 respectively so that's a total of 26 - not 35 34 i know there is tax but really 9 34 of tax i think i was charged for those two little 'spits' of wine i could have ignored this but one of our group ordered a hamburger with fries and it included a glass of red wine in the price when she got home she checked her bill and wow she was charged for the glass of wine she called and the restaurant apologized and said they would credit the price of the wine but really a group of 6 people and 2 have bills that are wrong if they can sort out this problem with the charging it's a place to go again but i won't be back until they can give an itemized bill to each person 
this used to be my favorite ny style pizza place in all of tampa i have loved to see how much they have grown and expanded we used to go weekly or i would pick it up on my way home from work we moved so we don't make it as often as we used to and i guess we haven't missed out on much since the past 3 times have been very disappointing things that i believed changed are 1 quality in cheese - over the years been going for 12 years i believe they changed the cheese pizza seems more greasy which leads me to believe they have chosen a lower quality cheese 2 they are so busy which is great for them the pizza is not cooked like it used to be they open the ovens so much to warm up slices that the whole pies don't get a chance to cook evenly maybe have one over for slices and one for whole pies we now ask them to cook it twice 3 the staff - they staff was never all that great but now they just seem like they don't care at all place needs to be cleaned up a bit too seemed to get dirtier every time we go parking is the same as it has always been - you can get lucky and get street parking free on the weekends and free after 6 00 during the week or if you don't want to hunt for a spot they have a good sized lot across the street that you have to pay for 
great food and ice creams the staff are extremely friendly and on point i have been stopping in here for about 2 years now and always leave a satisfied customer i highly recommend this sweet little hotspot 
i am so disappointed we were eyeing this for a while and finally decided to try it - we had heard good things about other locations there were only 8 other tables with people at them and no more than 4 at any table in the entire restaurant but it still took the server 10 minutes to greet us and it took 70 minutes to get our food there were only two of us and we ordered simple dishes when the server delivered our food she said your food's late because there's only 3 cooks working tonight and walked away which didn't explain why 2 tables who were sat after us - with more people at them - got their food before we did and then the food all i can say is don't get the pot roast just don't i'm pretty sure it's day-old dinty moore 
11 2 2019 we were just at ruby river steakhouse sat down order got our drinks and salad and we see a mouse running around it took a while for someone from restaurant to come out a manager never came out they let the employees try and catch it we told our server we were leaving he asked the manager if he could comp our drinks salad manager said yes to salad but made us pay our drinks i was in completely shock how the manager handle he situation i can't believe he never came out to apologize to us and the other people that were leaving and then to top it off he made us pay for the drinks it sure makes me think that if there is one mouse there has to be more and no one there seem to care don't eat here
looking for a clean bed and room for one night this was not what i expected for a hundred dollars bedspread is stained and has a cigarette hole burned through it room smells musty and the carpet is moist blech tv doesn't work and it is caked in dust how hard is it to dust the top of a flat panel tv no wifi one positive the nice young lady who checked me in gave me a free bottled water so that's worth a star chinese restaurant connected to the lobby was meh 
my son and i went to hyde park prime steakhouse in downtown indianapolis for dinner yesterday evening it was the first time there for both of us hyde park does not have a parking lot although they do offer valet service other options would be street parking as available or tucking into one of the downtown parking garages once inside we had a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience the decor and ambience were welcoming and sophisticated and the service was quite good our server was jared and he was friendly and professional graciously answering our questions and explaining for us various menu items one small negative note was that the service at times was attentive to the point of being intrusive with various servers staff stopping at our table to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything--and hence interrupting our conversation--at three minute intervals we shared an order of wagyu carpaccio for an appetizer then we each ordered a bone-in ribeye cooked blue for dessert my son had the molten lava cake and i had the cheesecake with cherries it was all wonderful the steak being a special delight hyde park can be pricey--the bill for food and drinks for two of us before tip totaled over 200--but the meal and experience were well worth it 
the best coffee shop in nashville great coffee and atmosphere kindest baristas and there is a lot of space for sitting and working the space is very open and allows for a lot of light it is a family friendly environment and a breathe of fresh air from other pretentious coffee shops 
i was very upset by the quality of chip i was given they were soggy stale and lacked crunch do better please tacos and guac were great 
the most tender ribs ever near place coming back for live music can't wait for to cool off so i can sit outside
food best dish three flavors dumpling shrimp pork chives beef dumplings were just okay fried chicken was kinda gross with lots of hair still on the chicken service atmosphere non-existent when it's not rush hour you feel like you're in the owners' living room because they chat on the phone loudly and yell at you from the counter when your food is ready if i came back it would only be to get takeout of the three flavors dumplings
zinburger is pretty amazing there were 4 of us that visited this establishment and all of us loved the food there's a wide assortment of different burgers which i'm sure are all awesome although i highly recommend the bruce lee burger asian bbq sauce avocado jalape o slaw cucumber vinaigrette and sriracha sauce i know now why they call it the bruce lee burger because it literally felt like bruce lee kicked me in the mouth but it was sooooo worth it our server was amazing she was friendly and was knowledgeable about everything on the menu why the 4 stars well i ordered a chocolate shake to go with my burger and asked to have no whipped cream you guessed it it came with whipped cream no big deal i asked the runner that brought the shake to if she could give me something like a small bowl so i could dig out the whipped cream she grabs the cup out of my hand and rolls her eyes and proceeds to takes it in the back for those of you that have seen the movie called waiting should already know i didn't drink that shake when she brought it back out i'm not crazy i did ask the server to take it off of the bill though overall we'll come back to this place because the food is that good i just hope we don't get angry alice as our food runner next time 4 stars and two thumbs up for the food happy eating my foodies 
a friend and i went here on a suggestion i wouldn't ever come back it cost too much for 2 taco looking fajitas rice beans beef nachos and sodas the food is mediocre overly priced and poorly thought out the portions were small and served on singular paper plates it was all very bland and not prepared with care i ordered the beef fajitas plate with rice and beans the rice and beans was the highlight of my meal because those were at least flavorful the pico that came on the side had a fresh zest my fajitas tortilla shells didn't come separate from my meat they came all together and the fajitas consisted of saut ed onion and meat with cabbage lettuce cheese in a soggy tortilla shell the silverware and utensils are plastic and too small chips and salsa are not included in the meal which is strange of tex-mex themed food places taco bell would have been cheaper and yummier the nachos seemed to lack an adequate amount of cheese 
this has to be one of the worst meals i have ever eaten their gluten free pasta tastes like what i imagine wallpaper glue tastes like the sauce was barely there and had an overwhelming garlic and oil taste after a few bites i actually threw the dish in the trash i will never go back 
fantastic restaurant went there for my birthday prior to a concert at glencairn museum so glad we made reservations because the place was packed early a line quickly formed out the door my companion i couldn't get over how each plate was so artfully served staff was super attentive without being up your nose throughout dinner everything was absolutely delicious my companion i are looking forward to returning soon 
the place is now closed with multiple available for rent signs i had been trying to contact them for over a week and have yet received no notices on them closing their website says nothing and there are no signs indicating the state of the business on site 
worst service i ever had i came in with my wife for lunch ordered imperial rolls and pork bbq meal waited then all of a sudden its been like 20 mins and have not gotten my order 4 groups who came after us already got there ordered when to talked to the owner and didnt even apologize rude vietnamese attitude will never ever recommend going to this stinky shithole restaurant 
first of all let's be ready for a wait of 10 minutes or a bit longer do not become inpatient because this place is worth the wait my waitresses name was tina she was super sweet and very attentive i asked her for ideas on what to order since i figured she would know best assuming she's eaten there before sheet me know my choice was a great one when i received my plate of food i was surprised to see the amount of food i received everything was delicious and our food came out fairly fast they do serve alcohol they have a bar area with tvs i will be recommending this place to all my friends i cannot wait to go back i am very satisfied with the service 
this place is poorly run i think a mcdonalds manager could have run a better restaurant than this place absolutely awful and i will never be back absolutely awful 
best dunkin around friendly people all the time fast service today i went in to get an iced coffee i usually go into the drive thru but today i went in and my coffee was perfect my sandwich was made fast i sat inside to eat and when i was leaving i had asked to put more toasted almond flavor in and she not only did that but put more coffee in without me asking 10 10 only dunkin i go to and it's super close to me how convenient 
got the burger topped with pulled pork and it was amazing good burger topped with first rate pulled pork perfectly cooked and just enough sauce i'm doing the low carb thing and requested it without the bun they took the time to make an outstanding presentation the only problem was their home made potato chips i ended up eating all of them our waitress gina informed us that the chips were available as an appetizer with bacon horseradish sauce my diet is doomed on my next cheat day truly a great place to eat with informed staff and thoughtful chefs 
we went here for my mom-mom's birthday dinner - she wanted to pick the place and this was it we had about 10 people so we were seated at a large table in one of the dining rooms we had an early reservation but the place really started to fill up while we were eating it seems like their floors are not level because 3 different people had their glasses of water slide off the table and break within our first 30 minutes there after we all arrived and were settled the menus were distributed its a byob so that was nice for appetizers we tried the mussels and the burrata and tomato salad special the burrata and tomato salad was delicious but the mussels were not the mussels were still sandy and were very very chewy -- they were actually one of the worst mussels i have ever tasted even the broth the mussels were served in was sandy salty and had an unpleasant fishy taste for our meals many of us ordered pizza those that did not order pizza got a pasta and chicken dish the pasta and chicken dishes were okay certainly nothing special one perosn commented that the pasta was not cooked correctly my aunt got the margherita pizza which was by far the best pizza i ordered the diavola spicy pizza and was extremely disappointed i usually can handle spice pretty well but this pizza was just inedible the spice was extreme and was not balanced by any other flavors the arugula pizza was dominated by arugula and not really any other toppings and was extremely salty finally they were offering a free appetizer if you checked in on yelp our waitress said it was a hassle to take the coupon up front and said she would take care of it when the check came but she never did we were so disappointed with our meal we didn't even bother arguing about the coupon overall i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone 
one of my favorite places staff is eh ok not rude not friendly a little forgetful but the menu makes up for it i'll always remember salmon and pumpkin sauce 
my husband and i moved into a home with no refrigerator and needed one fast i saw express appliances' ad on craigslist and we headed down to boise from kuna masks are required but i forgot mine express appliance supplied me with one so i could enter with my husband thank you we found the frig we wanted and went with the financing option it was super quick easy and immediately approved they gave us a fast delivery of 3 days and when matt arrived to deliver he was very nice and friendly which made my day he put the frig exactly where i asked was fast and professional he made the interaction a pleasure you have a great asset in matt please let him know how much i appreciated him and how nice he was we will tell our friends about express appliance whenever they need a new appliance very impressive thank you so much matt and express appliance you all rock a company 
jesus my cashier gave great service thanks it turns out the new owners have changed the pretzel into a pretzel stick with dipping sauce so not the same at all sad face i read the other reviews about this location and went here anyway love me some eegees i ordered a deluxe grinder with no lettuce or tomato the manager expedited my order along with another guy who had been waiting since i got there cool when the girl with the beautiful eyelash extensions brought out my sandwich and called my name i said no lettuce or tomato she confirmed when i got back to work to eat it it was missing onions which i do really like but the sandwich is still awesome and everything else was right this place does have some excellent service i would definitely recommend this location and will be back if i'm in the neighborhood thanks crew and manager for a delightful experience 
i can't believe they stop selling my midnight pomegranate that was my absolute favorite came in thinking i was going to be able to stock up to my dismay they no longer sell it nor are they selling malibu heat they do have a pretty good special going by three get two free i'm still a little sad about the midnight pomegranate but i was able to try out some of the new scents such as hawaii oahu those are great 
fresh food excellent service family atmosphere loved it the mole chicken enchiladas were amazing i even took a pic my fiends each ordered something else and they all loved theirs also can't wait to go back 
rude sat for 40 minutes never again w these nail salons that have just terrible customer service i guess it doesn't matter how you treat people because they'll fill up with women every day and we are a dime a dozen
i was staying at the inn next door for a couple nights and ate here for dinner twice i like the atmosphere - laid back good for an after-work drink and some straight-up no frills food i tried a gyro my first evening it was okay but wouldn't get it again second night i just got the chicken wing appetizers they were awesome got 'em spicy and boy were they waitstaff was super helpful and friendly as were the other folks in there i especially liked that there was a guy playing guitar each night i was there he had a great voice and was doing some great covers prine beatles and various rock and country tunes awesome 
our a c broke and ross heating air had a lower service call charge than another big company and my sister highly recommended them dustin was right on time to our house and called and texted to let me know he was on his way the company texts you a picture of your service person and a little bio about them dustin was quick to fix our a c and was very professional have already recommended this company to several friends i will definitely use them again 
super disappointed we love tahoe burger and was hoping for a nice ice cream yogurt place next door but no it was terrible and even if it was somewhat decent - the price was outrageous the toddlers didn't even like the place and that is saying a lot the layout is cramped and weird the people working there were nice enough but if the product is c p - then what's the point they should close this disastor and bring in a self-serve place that charges by the ounce you are much better off getting a milk shake at tahoe burger and then going somewhere else for yogurt 
as of right now my fiance is about 18 weeks pregnant the experience we have had so far with this company have been nothing but problems we have had 5 appointments set up and all but two have been canceled by them they were suppose to do tests for down syndrome and since the canceled all the appointments the baby is to far along now and they had to a less accurate blood test today she was spotting and called to get in she called at 8am and was told they would call back it is now 2 pm and they have yet to call back we ended up going to the er and was taken care of there they do not care about their patients they will cancel appointments the day of they will make you wait sometimes 2 hours to see them and if you have an emergency they will not even see you let alone help you stay away from this company at all costs 
now this was during covid times so it may be different sometime but we went on a friday night it was a mixture of brotastic and old white folks who want to be seen no one were wearing masks except for the employees the union burger was just ok the yardbird was good fries were terrible that and two sodas tax was 47 ouch if you are a bro a bro hookup or an old white person who enjoys form over function then it will be fine my wife and i will probably not ever come back until we want to take my inlaws who love these kinds of places where the food doesn't matter as much as the atmosphere 
michelle is absolutely ridiculous did this girl even go to school she can't cut hair she chops hair she took off at least 4 inches too much on my daughters hair and chopped up pretty much holes in my sons hair did she use scissors or a chainsaw it was horrendous if you go to this place make sure you don't see michelle she doesn't know what the heck she is doing she will ruin your hair 
i got an iced coffee and a pour over it was just the worst coffee ever for the price of the coffee they only carry one size small
i always leaving way too full and spending too much money 60 for 2 people yeah the food is pricey but its good they claim everything is local plus they serve kaldi coffee that's a plus my favorite is the berries and creme french toast and the chicken sausage patties 
loved cypress breeze farm trail ride i decided to take my girlfriend on a trail ride for her birthday she grew up around horses and really missed the sights sounds and smells so i started to do some research thanks again yelp we actually had our ride booked with another place i will not mention cough ruskin cough and when i started looking around they had terrible reviews about the overall experience i checked a couple places out and decided we would give cypress breeze a shot we talked to monica and from the start knew we would have a great experience they really care for their animals there and love what they do this all comes out with the postive attitudes from everyone involved if you are from pinellas county you might recognize downtown st petersburg has a horse and buggy for rent yep thats them also the big guy bill is awesome we loved our experience and would definitely go back 
ghetto i wasn't greeted when i walked in cashier never even made eye contact with me burger was ok but not worth 12 with a drink i ordered fries but didn't get them because cashier didn't charge me for them worst service i've experienced jn a long time i'll never be back 
omg i've tried so many places but this is the real deal my eyelashes and my eyebrows are gorg it takes me half the time to get ready now i highly recommend this establishment 
great food excellent staff burgers are brilliant wings are awesome i'm sure i'm spelling it wrong but emuriga something like that our waitress was perfect 
exceptional food service can't wait to go back fajitas were top notch the mariachi plate did not disappoint endless chips salsa chula's had me at frozen margaritas 
stopped in to this local joint after reading the reviews on yelp the restaurant is located in an old grocery store shopping center tucked way in the back when you walk in your immediately welcomed by the smell of meat on the griddle i am not a huge meat eater and i like the healthier side of things but the smell did not seem like most greasy burger joints or the likes of those the atmosphere is very much geared towards baseball and sports fans after looking around at the clientele i was one of three women in the whole place the rest were men probably 25 lol go meat eating men the man at the counter was very nice and helpful and gave me some suggestions on what to get for a healthier sandwich there i chose the hot roast pork sandwich with grilled onions lettuce tomatoand hot peppers it took probably 10 minutes to get my sandwich but it didn't seem long since i was taking in all the baseball paraphernalia and all of the awards on the walls the restaurant i can tell you appears very clean and well-maintained which is very important to me the taste of the sandwich was excellent i have to say the bread was light and crispy on the outside and soft and tasty on the inside the roasted pork melted in my mouth i did not have any of the fattening add on's such as mayonnaise or cheese or things like that still the sandwich was the bomb i got the smallest sandwich they offer and it was still quite large for my normal sandwich size but i ate the entire thing feeling a little guilty but hey what can you do - also did i mention the price this large to me sandwich was a mere 4 50 score all in all a great experience so this place gets a very strong four star review from me i will for sure go back and this time bring my husband 
my favorite place for beer in nashville my husband loves the beer here lots of ipas and more i highly recommend it 
constantly have staff that arrive a few minutes early but are always unwilling to help and since i work at night this is more than a bit inconvenient claimed they would have no way to take the item out of stock but they could just as easily have written the item number down taken my cash and had the cashiers ring it up later any place that turns away some business deserves none too bad there is no option for no stars 
i can't speak for the food but there's nothing wrong with the sundaes or shakes in this old-fashioned ice-cream parlor the wait staff was prompt and friendly it was clean if a bit outdated-- but that's part of the charm i think and the ice cream is delicious hubs has a cookies and cream shake and i had the cookie dough sundae both were very good and very rich couldn't finish mine and i was even sharing with a toddler 
my car was a mess got a full detail inside and out my car looks brand new this place is great 
cool location but the iced coffee i ordered tasted like folgers the teas i tasted were delicious though 
i wish there was someway to separate the restaurant and the ice cream parlor this review is about the ice cream parlor it's awesome they serve gourmet ashby's ice cream and they choose some of the more exotic flavors that ashby's makes carrot cake flavor is shockingly good the banana and cookies flavor tastes just like nilla wafers and - surprise - banana pudding you have to go in and try it another thing their ice cream parlor is off to the side so you don't have to be seated to get served you can just go to the ice cream parlor and order the staff is friendly and chatty they are very generous with their sample sizes and i get the feeling they would have let us try a sample of all 20 flavors if we had asked recommend 
amazing breakfasts check monster sandwiches and portions check dr browns soda check for a jewish kid raised around these types of food when i walk in to famous and see their long glass cases filled with huge pastries cakes followed by smoked fish and deli meats i can feel it in my heart no that's my my heart preparing for the artery clogging goodness that awaits it that's love that i'm feeling famous runs the show for the jewish deli scene in the philadelphia area the closest thing to famous between here and nyc is harold's deli in edison nj though famous is obviously much closer everything at famous is huge from the challah french toast to the bowls of soup to especially the sandwiches the sandwiches are easily enough to share unless you have an endless pit of a stomach like me famous is perfect for breakfast especially on sundays then it's the place to be ask for a booth by the windows which is a line of maybe 15 booths that run along bainbridge so you can watch all the action my personal recommendations breakfast the traditional challah french toast kippered salmon platter ask for a scoop of whitefish salad to accompany your platter and mix both on your bagel this is the breakfast of champions lunch and dinner roast beef special on rye russian dressing and cole slaw if you're a fan of nyc jewish deli's you'll fall in love with famous the second you walk inside as you're eating your leftovers the next day you can't help but fall in love with famous all over again 
dined here about a week or so ago 1 star the ambience was nice the faux outside area they have going on is very charming 2 star the food was decent even good for some items i liked the spicy sweet potato fries the fried brussels sprouts were interesting to say the least tasted very much like seaweed on the outside i don't think its worth getting my cheese sandwich was pretty hard to eat all around i love crunchy but it was a bit too crunchy a hard stale type thats difficult to bite through i had to kind of eat around it or rip it off but the taste of the sandwich for a grilled cheese was not bad the tomato bisque soup was surprisingly tasty i would order it again if i wanted something light one of the better tomato bisques i've had -1 star we had a reservation and we still had to wait more than 15 minutes there were a couple tables open during the time we waited open tables while having a queue usually means the servers are busy and can't take more tables at the moment not enough servers -2 star hostess reception area is not very friendly they weren't exactly rude per say but the vibe i got from them was not positive plus i didn't like the fact that they had like 5 people in the way of the entrance that were waiting around for a while and they didn't say anything to them but after they were seated me and 2 other girls of minority were standing around waiting for a table to free up for the reservation we made and we were told to move out of the way we ended up just standing around a couple feet away lol although it's already a cluttered area before the entrance of the dining area might i suggest clearing up some space to place some chairs as a waiting area off to the side or perhaps incorporating one of those buzzing pagers so we can go explore or wait in other lounge areas without being in the way i completely understand it can get annoying having people crowd the entrance but the way we were told to move could have been delivered in a more friendlier tone without the negative vibe -3 star our server was not bad she knew the menu well enough to answer our questions and accommodated us when she could she made a great recommendation to one of my friends who ended up loving her tea one of my friends and i shared the brussels sprout appetizer and wanted to split the item for our separate checks and for what ever reason they charged our cards in two different transactions each quite odd and costly for the restaurant with the credit card fees but anyways this lack of the third star doesn't quite reflect on her but the restaurant service as a whole i'm in the hospitality business as well so i can empathize with servers who give off the stressed vibe from having to do too many things at once while attending to customers and trying not to rush them i don't know if the restaurant is understaffed or if the servers don't know how to utilize their service to the best of their abilities but perhaps someone would like to look into the wait time of flipping tables or hiring more servers i get understaffing for smaller restaurants but with a successful and constantly busy venue such as this establishment i feel more can be done this was actually my second attempt here my first experience was very upsetting a friend made a reservation for 3 ppl at 4pm we came 15-20 minutes early and was seated as we waited for our third party 10 minutes till 4pm we were told the kitchen was closing and our third party was not here yet why on earth would you take a 4pm reservation if your kitchen closes before 4pm i live out near clearwater beach it takes me roughly about 45 minutes give or take with the traffic to get here driving all that way to have lunch with my girls for a reservation that was taken and then told the kitchen closes before the reservation time is completely bad service one would think they would honor the time of the reservation along with the couple minutes it takes to go over a menu without being rushed to get a order in well we left since they did not welcome our reservation that they took nor did they want to wait for us which was clearly stated i wanted to love this place because my girlfriend does and i always give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt because they can have their bad days but i believe this restaurant just isn't for me on a positive note from my negative ranting there was a complete random gentleman server who noticed me making a snooty face to a dirty cup that i was inspecting of mine and he came by to ask if i would like a new one he wasn't even our server but i loved the fact that he paid attention and cared enough to accommodate me i don't know if he will read this by chance but thank you very much i appreciated it d
wortst theatre ever if you want to watch a film with a bunch of cell phone conversations and with a running commentary provided by the patrons than this is your type of place there was a group of elderly women talking back at the screen the bathroom stalls didn't lock properly again my first and likely last visit 
one of my favorite tasting rooms in santa barbara always a top recommendation to friends family and clients coming into town and looking for a true santa barbara experience delicious wines and friendly staff located in a very convenient downtown location near fabulous restaurants and historic sites 
4 5 stars for tonkotsu chashu ramen and 3 5 stars for other food they should really work on the smell of the restaurant probably because of the open kitchen and bad ventilation i smelled like tempura all over every time after eating there i would never go eating there if i need to meet non-family people afterwards once i also saw a running rodent there near the dining tables 
i was so excited when i saw an ad in our local paper for penguin pretzel factory i literally got in the car and immediately drove there i had such high hopes being the pretzel enthusiast that i am the place was fairly crowded at 4 00 pm on a tuesday i placed my order and asked that my order be made fresh i was assured that yes it would be made fresh fresh is what i wanted and i didn't mind waiting first of all my experience with the cashier was ridiculous when i handed him my card to pay for my order he handed my card back to me and said i'm going to let you do this part i asked why and he said because there are a few choices to make and you are the one who must make them i looked at the screen after swiping my card and i couldn't believe that the choices he mentioned were as follows 20 tip 18 tip 15 tip or no tip i told him that i have never been asked to tip an establishment for a to go order placed at a counter i chose no tip and just put a dollar in his tip cup i think it is rude and inappropriate to try to force your customers to leave a tip for a to go order the owner should pay their employees a decent wage instead of forcing their customers to tip them to compensate for their low salary why don't they just leave a tip cup on the counter for people who wish to leave a tip that s a terrible policy in my opinion after waiting more than 15 minutes in the car i went back in to see if my order was ready and waited another 5 minutes inside the time i spent waiting was not for my order to be made fresh it was spent serving other customers i watched closely as one of the employees finally bagged my order he grabbed everything i ordered from the plastic cases under the lights i'm not sure how long that food was sitting there there was only 1 item i ordered that was made fresh only because there were none ready it was the chicken bacon ranch pretzel sandwich i ordered about 30 00 worth of food which was a stupid thing to do i should have just tried 1 or 2 things before spending so much money i didn't say anything about my order not being fresh i just disappointedly grabbed the bag and left hoping for the best i drove 1 5 miles to my parents house and laid all of the pretzels out on the table and we tried everything i ordered a spinach and feta sandwich a chicken bacon ranch sandwich 2 hot dog pretzels 2 pretzel twists and 2 cinnamon pretzel twists let me start off by saying that it was obvious that everything except the chicken bacon ranch sandwich was not fresh the dough was hard and everything was very greasy the hot dog pretzels were pretty good and i'm sure would be much better if made fresh the cinnamon desert pretzels were also pretty good although very greasy and would have been much better if made fresh after sitting under that light for a period of time anything would begin to get hard and grease soaked the regular pretzel twists were so hard that we couldn't eat them and the spinach feta sandwich was ok but very greasy the chicken in the chicken bacon ranch pretzel tasted like flavorless rubber which ruined the sandwich i won't be going to the penguin pretzel factory again and i advise anyone placing an order to request it freshly made but you must stand there the whole time and make sure they don't give you anything from the plastic case under the lights because that is certainly not fresh i hope this helps 
my family and i tried it for the fist time last week and it was very good the restaurant is beautiful inside the service excellent and the food was great we will definitely be back 
i came here for a birthday celebration and was surprised how great the food was they serve small med and large plates we all ordered small plates to share among the 8 of us everything was great well prepared and fun to share my favorite dish the duck with foie gras flatbread for 16 there was a real piece of foie gras on the flatbread big enough that another 4 star restaurant would have charged the same price just for the foie gras the flatbread itself was on the smaller side 4 pieces but had ample duck on it was very tasty i also loved the baked brie cheese and the crispy brussels sprouts i loved this place and would definitely recommend it go back i think it's comparable to amada but with more of an american flair great place to share dishes 
what a wonderful hotel we were in for w conference the conference room food facilities were great the staff of the hotel went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable such friendly people the hotel itself was beautiful clean and updated valet parking was quick and efficient the room was spacious and the bathroom was luxurious i would highly recommend this hotel even if it's not right downtown there is a metrolink station nearby though 
i came here for easter brunch yesterday the place was packed but they handled it with poise there were 10 of us and our waitress managed to fulfill everyone's requests while inserting some wit and charm that made us all really enjoy her the menu was a price fixe- 3 courses for 29 change as a vegetarian my options were incredibly limited our reservation was at 1p and we didn't eat anything prior to arriving i feel like that was our biggest mistake they brought out some pastries which we promptly consumed in entirety and then requested more which our waitress did very kindly i ordered the spring asparagus i expected big fat asparagus spears with the equivalent of a poached egg on top what i got was skinny yet tasty asparagus spears with a hard boiled egg a quarter of an egg crumbled it looked beautiful but i really would have loved more of it i got the quiche as my entree it was a fairly decent sized piece of quiche but again i think i was just ravenous by the time we got there i ate pretty much everything on my plate and was still pretty hungry some of the other dishes namely the salmon and the steak and eggs looked much more filling just not for me - for dessert i had the creme brulee which was huge and delicious that was the biggest score yet easter happened to be my birthday the waitress forgot to put a candle in my brulee at first but quickly righted herself and my family sang at me awkwardly as the atmosphere is very dignified and upscale the desert was heaven it was one of the most delicious things i've ever ate i'd go back just for this alone all in all my experience at vickers was nice i'd love to have left a bit more full but i was happy with my food and the service was great 
i love the pizza and the weekday deal of two slices of cheese pizza and a soda for five bucks it's the best pizza outside of jersey 
great location decent coffee and baked goods but the service is very poor staff give you the impression that they really dont want to be there and they really wish you had gone somewhere else to order your coffee i wont be back 
definitely one of the best mexican food places in sb very casual but nice atmosphere the house salad salsa bar guacamole and salmon tacos are awesome good selection of beers including some local craft - 805 is a favorite 
i held off on writing this review to see how the hotel's general manager responded to my comments to her privately i believe in giving a business a chance to correct a mistake or make good on an error that did not happen so here goes my husband and i stayed at the hotel on a friday and saturday night the weekend of father's day after checking in at around 3 00 pm we were directed to our room which was on the second floor in another building big long staircase no offer of help with luggage but that is very minor our room which got direct afternoon sun was 91 degrees when we entered it the air conditioning would not kick in had a ridiculous note on it that said we had to give it 10 minutes to kick in after giving it three separate 10 minute attempts we called the front desk and was told someone would come up someone did very nice young man what he told us and what the next 2 young men told us after calling 2 more times was literally the most ridiculous direction and explanation on the clearly malfunctioning air conditioning i had ever heard it was not working at all we were sweltering they had no other rooms they gave us a fan yup a fan but wait it gets better after melting through that night and getting ready for the party that brought us to santa barbara in the first place ever try to blow dry your hair in a room that is 90 degrees you could wring me out after that the next day we got back to the hotel after the party that evening to a room that was not only 95 degrees but had a stink so strong it made us both nauseous i know that smell i've smelled it before i'm not going to say what i am sure it was without visual proof but know that the building where our room was is a few feet away from the kitchen of the restaurant housed in another building on their grounds and you know what restaurant kitchens attract sometimes those attractions get poisoned and die in walls and ceilings of nearby buildings and that situation has a very distinctive terrible awful smell that was the smell in our room so not only was it sweltering it stank to high heaven we were paying 380 night for that we told the front desk they had to do something for that night our second of the stay they had another room with a smaller bed in another building we could have we had no choice we had to take that room which i admit was nice it was cool and didn't stink but when we reached out to the general manager for what was a deserved refund for at least some of the charges you know what she said she said we could have one free night on our next stay as long as it was a sunday through thursday night what no thank you this hotel doesn't get another penny of my money no matter what night but to insult us further by making such a paltry offer is beyond reason they are in the hospitality business maybe they should learn how to be hospitable 
we came here recently for dinner and it was a nice homey place we shared a large pizza and added pineapple as an extra topping which was wonderful we were impressed by how much pineapple they added to our pizza which made me really pleased as a patron this location has high chairs available and the restrooms are small but functional staff were really helpful also we'll definitely be back at some point when we want such deep pizza with lots of toppings and will keep this place in mind for takeout delivery as well i'm also curious about the rest of the menu 
this is my favorite mediterranean place in the new orleans area my wife and i were dining at this very restaurant when we decide to start dating one another so it definitely a special place for us we recently went to dinner there the past valentine's day for a little reunion the kabobs are our go to and we typically start off with the grape leaves the hummus is great so definitely recommended getting that as one of your two sides you get with an entree nice little quiet spot perfect for a date night you won't be disappointed 
it was over rated and over priced for products they serve you can find a lot better small plates dishes elsewhere additionally it was dark and loud nothing tastes good in dark and i could not enjoy any conversation since it was way too loud though i have heard good thing about omakase sushi maybe i will try omakase 
delicious enjoyed a nice bowl of pho for lunch the broth is so good you dont want to stop the resturaunt eas clean and quiet and the server was attentive 
my husband and i had a couple's massage today service at the front desk was fast professional and personable the massage therapists were wonderful they were both accommodating very professional and provided excellent massages about a half hour after leaving i realized that my wedding ring fell out of my pants pocket so i called and they went into the room and found my ring the place was clean serene and they didn't try to up-sell me on anything additional that i don't need at check out i appreciate that very much because at other locations i've had to listen to the up-sell shtick we will definitely go back to this location 
i have taken many trips with los padres outfitters and they are truly the best and only proper outfitter in the southern los padres national forest graham really takes care of his guests - he is a great cook and serves up all sorts of tasty treats he has really calm mules and horses that know the trails so you don't have to worry about it and of course he takes you to the prettiest scenery that the los padres has to offer i can't recommend him highly enough a 
i have always come to joto's for lunch but decided to take my 2 boys for dinner went on a friday night where they close at 10 30pm we got there at 10 10pm they served us but wow they were not happy the staff who served spent so much effort pressuring us to hurry up and leave the whole time we were there so disappointed not sure how many times the waitress and manager came over to ask if we were done but it was a lot sushi was good but i lost a lot of respect for them i won't be back--lunch or otherwise 
caffeinated bakery is under new management i visited one day during lunch and was pleasantly surprised at such cozy atmosphere and really friendly service for lunch i had their soup of the day and a ham and cheese sandwich on a croissant both were delicious finally i got a water ice dessert it's really interesting in that it's not quite gelato but not snow cone either a happy medium if you will i got pina colada mango and cotton candy yum my favorite part was how affordable everything was which is great because beach prices suck when you work on the beach and you're hungry stop by when you get a chance and relax this spring and summer 
this place is awesome took mass transit into town and needed to get my nails done near my hair salon i popped into old city and i'm thrilled with the results the staff is friendly and welcoming they understood i was pressed for time so i had 2 ladies working on me at once they made small talk and kept an eye on the clock for me i was running out of time during my pedicure my fault and the ladies allowed me to come back after my hair appt to finish up i have short nails that aren't easy to work with and my techs took such good care of me i'll definitely be back prices are quite fair gel mani and gel pedi were 65 
recommended by a local on the basis of my question where can i get a good walk-in pedicure i walked in all right to the largest nail salon i had ever seen huge selection of polish prompt and friendly service super clean high tech spa chairs careful even when you are firm in your choice of services they'll keep asking if you want this and that 
how does marios have no reviews i adore marios and i live on the other side of the country when we fly here growing up it was very frequent-almost once a year marios is one of the first things on my mind over the years i have eaten marios pizza several times and it is consistently excellent not like anything i can get here afted a recent trip i remembered that i had not reviewed this place for pizza this is as good as it gets solid cheeses awesome basil-y sauce and fantastic crust with just the right amount of chew 
amazing burgers service this burger joint even has its own bar with a nice variety of brews my only con is if you have a big appetite like myself you'll have to add an extra patty to your burger for 2 because although they're very tasty they are kinda small for me at least this place is definitely worth a try if you're looking for a quit burger beer
consistently decent quality fast fresh food pasta say that five times fast order ahead and pick up almost immediately love the spicy chipotle adobo with pork in the past i feel noodles would wimp out on the spicy dishes this one is labeled very spicy and now has an appropriately hot taste tiny parking lot 2-3 cars is always full but there is nearby street parking 
typical walmart in any small town usa but had to stop here to get a few things we needed right away of course we found some other stuff we didn't need but had to buy too i was happy though that they carried a make up brand that i haven't seen in other walmarts it was super cheap wooo hooo 
my husband and i stopped for an early dinner in january on our way back home to naples this might explain why 5 00pm the restaurant was nearly empty which in of itself i don't take as a negative given so many indian restaurants in the usf vicinity this was one reason why i chose it and the other because of a groupon the food is typical indian american and good value for portions and quality my 3 star review reflects seasoning and flavor the waiting system of how spicy you want your food isn't comparable to the dozens of other indian restaurants i've eaten at most notably in the san francisco bay area best indian food in the u s if you want spicy like a 5 on a 1-5 scale ask for indian spicy my husband would have been happy with a 5 we ordered several items and nothing was a particular standout except for the mysore dosa from the south india limited sadly menu this is classic breakfast yes please in the karnataka state of sw india mysore or mysuru is one of its cities crepe made with rice lentil flour stuffed with potatoes mustard seed ginger curry leaves and topped with red chili chutney 
cheap cheerful fast turnover of tables and food as advertised need i say more decor - strange rooster and chicken obsession and apparently patrons in the past have stolen said decorations coffee is pretty good for a breakfast place poached eggs done properly not in a form thing great portions love the potatoes even though they look mass produced meat portions look good food is not greasy thank goodness pancakes and french toast are done well service is friendly and boy do they run around hap the owner is typically there working the front desk or serving coffee and sometimes his wife is there too much prefer the value and service to hipster over priced places 
i went to modern nails a few weeks ago the staff was really nice my only issue is that a mani pedi spa cost me 75 with tip i did get gel nails and i know those are more expensive than a normal manicure over the phone i was quoted 26 for a gel maincure and when i went to pay they referred me to a sign that said 35 for a gel manicure overall i had a decent experience until it was time to pay i am going to look for a cheaper nail salon 
i love rotiers - it is an old school neighborhood diner pub the hamburgers are amazing - the farthest thing from heart healthy lol
excellent everything is nearby easy on and off from interstate 10 very clean and staff extremely helpful well worth the price 
super cute space super friendly staff and delicious food the denver sandwich with chicken salad including grapes yum is unbelievable i think it might be the owner's mom's recipe but i might be making that up anywho this place is highly recommended 
a winery in plant city yep there's a lot to do you can take the tour which covers it all if you're not into wine or beer they have ciders available my personal favorite is the elderberry they have tours of both the winery and the vineyard available they have have merch and wine and beer available 
love this place and the price and they are always willing to do same day appointment and walk ins if you really need to be seen i enjoy the staff and the way it feels when you walk in 
i took my 9-year old pizza-loving son here not sure what to expect wow - we were pleasantly surprised first of all for a buffet it was extremely organized and clean the selections of pizza were consistently refreshed and in good condition the pastas were stored behind glass in containers so they stayed fresh the pasta sauces were awesome and varied the salad bar was the only slight disappointment but we weren't really there for the salad it was limited as far as the items were concerned but was stocked and fresh the varieties of pizza were great from the light flavor of the chicken alfredo to the heartier meaty hillbilly pizza the pricing was exceptionally good and we really enjoyed our visit we will definitely go back 
a great venue with a fun show went to see sweat had a great time seating was comfy great views from all over the theater we sat in the upper box 2nd row from back and had no issues enjoying the show 
my family and i was here on vacation i found this place on yelp i checked in and got the free maragrita our server kat was great she was very attentive we were a party of seven so we got several appetizers shrimp dip conch friters coconut shrimp and onion rings and they all were great i ordered the salmon felix for dinner and it was delicious everyone enjoyed thief food as well we will definitely visit this place again when we are back in town 
great and quick bite to eat right off the 101 had the crunchy asado tacos which were delicious chips were free but had to ask for a basket would recommend 
bagels are good on the smaller side tasty though fair prices long line but service with a smile and got our somewhat complicated order totally right which is appreciated the place was clean and the turkey sandwiches we got to take on a hike later for lunch held up wonderfully would return 
i was here last night oct 31st 2018 around 6 30pm for dinner when our party arrived we were prompted seated to our choice of outside where half of the tables were filled up 6-7 the only good thing i have to say about our entire experience is that our waitress was very nice our waitress clearly had her hands full with two serving staff for the entire restaurant two bartenders one for inside one for outside and a few food runners it took 10-15 minutes to order drinks and appetizers 45mins to get our apps in which if we hadn't been pre-occupied editing videos on a laptop we would have left we had already ordered our food our food took over an hour and half of our order was served to us incorrectly and some of it cold when it should have been hot seriously don't waste your time coming here i eat at fine dining restaurants all over the us and this restaurant doesn't deserve it's name to be prime 
i've been going to this sephora store for 7 years i have been part of the vib rouge program for 3 years i have always loved my trips into the shop the last two times have made me so uncomfortable employees followed me down every isle like i was a felon they never asks me questions just stare at me with no conversation i feel like i'm an inconvenience interrupting their social time because i come early around store opening i have two sons under two i always make sure they are completely entertained by a new toy and that they never touch samples or product most recently i did not even shop for what i wanted i just got what i knew i needed so i could leave i could not shake the uncomfortable feeling of being watched being watched without anyone asking if i needed help or what i was looking for i know that some kids probably destroy the store when they get the chance 
i've been to this restaurant 10 times and at one time considered this one of my favorite restaurants of it's kind -- not anymore i used to get the chorizo manchego and it was one of my personal favorites -- the last 2 times i've ordered it it's been half the size that it used to be but the price remains the same tonight i started with a 10 hummus plate that came with about 3 bites of terrible tasting hummus 4 super tiny pieces of naan bread and what seemed like vegetables that was cut 3 days ago this was terribly overpriced and tasted awful my wife ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich that came with almost no toppings -- and then it got better -- she pulled a long blonde hair that was nearly a foot long out of her sandwich we brought it to our server's attention who immediately resolved the issue by bringing us another but nothing else was offered as a previous server of 8 years i would have at least offered something to make things right typically really easy to deal with i didn't say anything other than thank you for bringing the new food -- it's not the servers fault my cali wrap was practically bathing in pesto aioli -- the sauce was literally pouring out of the wrap -- it was disgusting the bathroom is full of graffiti and vandalism the servers who at this rate are very tenured i've had most servers more than once all act like they hate their job and can't keep up with the pace this place used to be one of my favorites but it's simply going downhill 
every single time i have been here the workers are rude to me for no reason today i stopped by to order ice cream for my mother and i i tried ordering a double scoop for each of us and the girl seemed to have no clue what i was asking for after i explained multiple times and they still gave me one scoop not sure how hard it is to understand two scoops of each flavor considering this is your job worst dunkins baskin robbins i have ever been to glad to see by reading the reviews i am not the only one whoever the manager is - have a word with your employees 
wonderful fresh food everything made to order with exception of some casserole made dishes the chicken soup is like no other the wait staff is excellent the owner is hands on and will explain every dish in detail new gem in mount holly 
awesome service - we called when oyr 55 samsung 55 smart tv kept turning off and on intermittently the owner came out the same day that we called professional and friendly he took our tv and we got it returned to us - repaired - before we left for pa they really came through for us i would not hesitate to refer this company awesome and we're back in business with a repaired tv thanks larry 
when it comes to movie theaters in the doylestown area the barn is a pretty good option while the seats aren't quite as comfy as the ones at the regal in warrington they're definitely not bad ticket prices are pretty close to the rest of the area though if you're doing dinner beforehand consider going to uno's one shopping center over with your meal you can purchase tickets for the barn at a discount 
fun bar and large establishment gator balls firecracker fries cheese curds and lits are a must they have specials everyday and on wednesday's they have trivia and 25 wings tons of flavors for lits for those wanting a sweet concoction great for loud groups and weekends are popping here

we needed a qualified electrician to find out why our fuse would pop every time we plugged into a particular wall plug our house is only 2 years old so it didn't make sense mike came out he was on time and very professional and knew exactly what the problem was he came back a few days later and installed a new plug with its own circuit he did a great job and the price was reasonable and very fair for the work that was done i'd recommend them to anyone who needs an electrician 
brunch is one of those terrific excuses to socialize with friends eat some delicious food and enjoy a few drinks such was the case this past weekend when a large group of friends gathered at grille 54 for their wonderful sunday brunch grille 54 can be found in the citrus park westchase area along sheldon road it's directly across the parking lot from mellow mushroom and across the road from outback steakhouse and carrabba's it had been a while since my last visit to grille 54 and i was anxious to give the place another try since the recent yelp reviews were substantially more positive than during my previous visits thankfully the newer reviews are right on target the food has improved the drinks are great and the service was spot on i made the reservation for 16 of us and the manager said he could put us in their semi-private back room where we'd have lots of space and still be right next to the brunch buffet our server was a great guy named joe who did a flawless job of giving us an overview of the buffet selections filling drinks and whisking away the empty plates based upon the advice of tampa bay's very own brunch goddess katy s we knew that grille 54 offered a full raw bar with a selection of delicious sushi rolls a traditional breakfast buffet including an omelet station a traditional lunch buffet with asian and italian choices a carving station freshly-made pasta station fruit bar and dessert bar plus they had unlimited mimosas and bloody mary's live music and all of this for only 25 95 oh yes let the feasting begin now i realize that other brunches around the tampa bay area have beautiful water views and expansive menus with pretentious white-tablecloth service however it's hard to beat the quality and variety of the food served at grille 54 for that extremely reasonable price this is meant to be brunch for the average family rather than an expense account meal i started with a plate of sushi and added raw oysters peel n' eat shrimp and snow crab clusters for the first round the sushi was very fresh with lots of flavor i especially liked the playful spicy tuna hand rolls which were served inside of a baked nori seaweed cone they looked like little ice cream cones and were very delicious round two was a selection of breakfast items including eggs benedict served atop fried green tomatoes yum along that side of the buffet were warming trays with lots of bacon sausage links breakfast potatoes egg dishes and the omelet station i also tried an asian shrimp ball seafood dumpling -- not my favorite but it was different around the corner was the lunch-side of the buffet with some tasty italian pasta dishes lots of fresh salads a carving station with roast beef and the fresh fruit bar at the end of that side of the table was a collection of small dessert tastes with little cakes pies cr me brulees fruit cheesecakes chocolate chip cookies and so on throughout all of this joe was refilling mimosas and bloody mary's and making sure that we got our money's worth after much snarfing we all sat back very full and happy and declared this gathering a big success while joe divided up the bill and passed out checks he told us about the different specials nights at grille 54 monday nights are all you can eat crab legs wednesday nights are half-priced bottles of wine and other nights feature italian feasts and sushi feasts and more the regular menu at grille 54 is a combination of sushi italian and wood grilled beef chicken and fish truly a little bit of something for everyone our group really enjoyed the brunch outing and we'll have to do this again meanwhile i'm making plans to head back to grille 54 and give them a try for a regular dinner 
i've had ribs in kc tx nc and memphis these are the best ribs in america the sauce meat and seasoning make for a heavenly bbq experience sipping on a sweet tea while munching on their exceptional sides was a moment of paradise i won't soon forget great service and vibe i would literally go back to st louis just for their food 
i've used this store in the past and they're ok the good thing i like about the store is prices aren't crazy they're well-stocked and the staff is friendly the not so great things are parking spots and the associate-to-customer ratio is off which causes long lines and wait times one particular thing to note was their rental box program see photos the program's concept is great but it's obvious they don't wash sanitizer boxes from customer to customer which is gross covid-19 or not i was going to rent a few boxes but notes hair and other loose stuff if the box--gross as i said before the staff was friendly and prices were okay all in all it was a good experience at the uhaul store on gandy and i would probably return again 
after a business meeting with my accountant we drove back towards dale mabry to have lunch at grille one sixteen the grille is located in the same strip mall as cigar city's brewpub and not far from whole foods in the northdale area of carrollwood grille one sixteen has this main location in carrollwood and a second location in the southern end of tampa on dale mabry just north of kennedy boulevard the interior of the restaurant is sleek modern and minimal which made it perfect for us to have a business discussion without a lot of distractions i'm quite sure that they dim the lights in the evening making this a dark romantic setting the restaurant was surprisingly busy for a weekday lunch but this is one of the nicer restaurants in this section of town our server was right there as soon as we were seated took our drink orders and then gave us some time to look over the menu before returning to discuss the daily specials i opted for the seared tuna thai salad which had a generous serving of the sliced tuna sitting on top of mixed greens chopped mango sliced avocado and edamame with a spicy peanut dressing yum jerry my accountant jumped all over the fried grouper sandwich and proclaimed that was his favorite thing on the menu the lunch menu has lots of soups salads appetizers sandwiches burgers seafood entr es chicken wings and other types of entr es to delight your taste buds there's a full bar and an extensive wine menu but i stuck with iced tea since this was a business meeting i thought that grille one sixteen was a very nice upscale and elegant restaurant and would enjoy going back some time to try their happy hour drinks and dinner menu 
terrible at answering the phone but usually nice and helpful couple complaints i have is that they are very unorganized when i call it's almost impossible to get a hold of the front desk but other than that the people are nice and probably just short of staff 
i had the grilled salmon meal from eat to live cafe the food was amazing i ordered via the grubhub app the cook paid special attention to my order to ensure accuracy i loved he attention to detail and the taste of the food i cannot wait until the next time a 
this was our first time going to eggspectation we went for dinner and although they give you the dinner menu you can have the day breakfast menu as well- my husband had the french onion soup he enjoyed it they serve the bread outside the bowl a garlic bread flavorful but way to greasy he then had the flatbread sausage and pepper- which was excellent more like a pizza than a flat bread- but very tasty i had the heavenly crepe which had grilled chicken spinach mushrooms and three cheeses- it was delicious full of flavor from the cheeses and the chicken was done perfectly the side salad was also good- don't remember the flavor of the vinaigrette but good we saw some nice cocktails being made but didn't have any this visit will definitely be back service was also excellent and the manager came over to ensure all was good 
love coppertown definitely one of the best coffee breakfast in downingtown really nice staff they are fast and amazing 
what a great new edition to boise this is a new pizza buffet in the bench it is reasonably priced 6 between 2-4 and 8pm to close it's bright clean and even has really cool booths to sit in little alcoves the food is great a huge selection i really enjoyed their own speciality creation the firefighter it was delicious the other cool thing if you want a pizza not being served they will cook it up for you another cool addition is their pasta bar which you won't find at a lot of pizza buffets try the spicy sausage alfredo it's really good they have a variety of pastas which they cook to order and several different sauces to choose from all their food is fresh and full of flavor if your looking for a lunch spot with lots of choices this is the place don't forget their desert pizzas the carmel brownie pizza is delicious enjoy 
this was our 1st visit to the acropolis greek taverna my wife got the greek salad which she said was excellent it came with potato salad huge chunk of feta peppers and olives they should put an add chicken option on their menu however i got the spanakopita which was also very good pretty good portion but i'm not sure what to do with the tomatoes huge chuck of feta and tzatziki sauce that was on the side of my plate they should give you a pita with it or something overall it was very good and we would go back 
i go to dream nails exclusively great service - nice clean environment and everyone is always very friendly and professional v is the owner and his wife i always request one of them for my nails - then anyone avail for my toes they even do toes and nails at the same time if you request w appointment 
first time at this restaurant we ordered a 1 2 rack of ribs huge and a double meat plate with pulled pork and brisket sides included sweet potato casserole red beans and rice and greens all of the food was flavorful and delicious our server was great very personable and attentive we will definitely be back the next time we are in new orleans 
ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta with a crab cake on the side finished it in 9 min flat i'd say that's all i have to say but i also loved our girl jess m she was super great in helping us figure the food out and making our meal a great experience
5 stars for amazing food service cleanliness of restaurant overall ambience decor and for having a parking lot i've come here twice with large parties of family and friends - once was back in september '18 dim sum lunch time and once this past sunday evening food - salted peanuts on the table to begin your evening -pot stickers - a beautiful plate of crisp-brown pot stickers you'll have on the table a variety of sauces - soy the hot spicy mustard etc -soup dumplings - a nice bite size -spicy wontons - these definitely come with a kick -mongolian beef - a savory bite of meat with skinny slices -tea-smoked duck - this is definitely a highlight with a beautifully cooked center a substantial amount of meat per slice a uniquely satisfying flavor with each bite -snow peas and a-tsai - both are well-cooked and add some fresh vegetables to your meal -seafood pan-fried noodles - crispy noodles mixed with a nice sauce a large spread of carrots shrimp squid and other fixin's -egg tarts - bite sized crispy exterior with a hint of sweetness and soft inside that is not overpowering other dim sum dishes during lunch -pork buns - savory bbq flavor -radish cake - light and airy -servers are attentive and service typically brings dishes as they are ready -bathrooms are clean with an interesting sink design -parking next to the restaurant you'll have to pay 1 50-3 depending on your timing tips takeaways -the place to go for your dim sum needs -definitely get the tea-smoked duck -would recommend return every couple months to get your fill of excellent authentic chinese cuisine -can't go wrong with any of the dishes that are described above -parking lot
i had such excellent service here all of the workers were really pleasant and i met three who stood out in particular while getting my food they all introduced themselves whilst checking me out and putting together my order so i have to thank this location for hiring such great and kind workers p s if fernando will or nick read this keep doing what you're doing 
awesome experience went from feeling terrible to close to 100 iv therapy has become part of my routine staff was friendly space was clean and relaxing took around 30 minutes from check in to check out i could have stayed longer and enjoyed more oxygen 
the twisted indian food truck visited our offices today after much anticipation and they definitely delivered i had the half tikka masala half curry grilled chicken bollywood bowl with white basmati rice saut ed onions and peppers fresh spinach leaves cilantro and a side of raita yoghurt sauce the bollywood bowl was a generous portion not greasy well marinated not short of ingredients well spiced and quite tasty after trying both sauces i prefer the twisted indian's curry over their tika masala but both were very good my coworker got the coconut mint shrimp currito and liked his meal as well choose your proetein of none vegetarian paneer tikka masala bangladeshi cheese chicken tikka masala or curry coconut mint shrimp or lamb korma choose your carb currito 12 tortilla shell bollywood bowl rice bowl yogi fries crinkle cut fries tossed in an indian spice blend with tikka masala sauce tantric tacos 5 tortilla shell or naanwich indian pita the server taking orders was cordial and informative the server said the rice bowls had the most food so i'd definitely recommend those the lines were not long and we got our food within 5 minutes unlike other vendors twisted indian did not include tax on the prices from the sign so the bollywood chicken bowl was listed at 8 50 but ended up being 9 50 twisted indian food truck's graphics include a silhoette of the taj mahal and an elephent in cerimonial garb with a yellow background as far as food trucks go this has to be at the top of my list however a food truck will never get 5 stars as there is no table service or any place to sit down will be back again i look forward to the next time the twisted indian visits our office thanks guys 
great food great price fast service great for what you pay and expect from chinese fast food nothing creative just good chinese standards 
buyer beware- be sure you have a quote in hand- orherwise after installation you might find that the part is 3x more expensive than you expected 
i stumbled on this place in a desperate need for a blt wonderful blt with avocado and pickles--sounds simple but it was a really good sandwich good portion of friend with seasoning on them plenty of sweet tea refills the man working the tables was so nice--definitely will be going back for a quite lunch
it's ironic the place is called the sleep inn because you will not sleep here walls are so thin that normal conversations and other activities from adjacent rooms come through in crystal clear high definition dolby quality audio 
this is the first time in a long time that i have been physically ill due to poor quality food i cannot recommend this place to anyone everything tasted off like it was about to spoil there were too few vegetables available at least the ice cream was ok save your money and go to a quality chinese restaurant this place is garbage not worth the money no matter how hungry you are 
i've been on the hunt for good quick hibachi in nashville for a while since there are basically no places at all this place was pretty solid good price i got the hibachi shrimp it was quick and fresh and good good amount of food and the shrimp were large and plentiful the only thing i think could be better was the serving of vegetables but it was acceptable i will definitely be back might try sushi at some point 
limited to no vegetarian options server was behaving as if she was doing a favor by serving us 
the food is great i get takeout all the time and it's always really quick and even hot after a 20 minute drive home dine-in however is problematic the service is just exceptionally slow unreasonably slow it's not the wait staff usually it's the kitchen you can easily sit there waiting for half an hour after ordering occasionally more considering the difference between how quick takeout is and how slow the food arrives dine in i'd guess they're connected that because they're doing so much take out business which is more time sensitive to pickup they're letting dine in patrons wait not sure how to resolve that only so much kitchen space but i'm hesitant to dine in now because i'd rather not sit there waiting for so long 
i've been to this place several times unfortunately the experience has been a bit somewhat mixed every time i've gone the very first time i went the service was ok decent turnaround time and the food was good the server didn't speak english very well and couldn't quite understand what we were asking for in the order and with the check the next time i went the food was great but the service was sub-par to say the least everything was fresh right off of the stove good quality the food took forever as well as the server didn't bother checking in on us we've run out of water after each refill while waiting for 10-15 minutes between each time the server checked on us it would be understandable if the place was packed it was not and maybe 5 tables with people at them between 3 servers not to mention she got the order wrong and the appetizer came after the main course the last most recent memorable visit service was better and the food was good i try to sample the menu ordering a few different things this time i ended up getting the same thing as i have before but it was made different and somewhat inconsistent all in all this place is ok and i would go there in a pinch if i couldn't get into one of the other restaurants from gsr or on the strip the service has been good about half the time i've visited the food is good every time i've been and have yet to be let down on that the delayed wait seems to be pretty consistent for food and service which is the reason for the rating mostly the start are for the food quality delivery and presentation 
i understand the mixed reviews herein as lehman's is undoubtably perfectly imperfect for some the smoking instantly equals zero stars while for others the food service is simply not up to par i get it for me this is another endangered species local landmark that is what it is for a reason - history when i see the proverbial family owned since 26 b c i'm not looking for nouveaux cuisine i'm looking for tried and true staples served up in an atmosphere that has a lot of heart and soul by my scale lehman's gets 5 stars my bartender was warm friendly and patient i got exactly what i was looking for for a chilly rainy-day late lunch french onion soup a liverwurst on rye potato salad and cold beer the chubby regular complainer next to me seemed about halfway to his drinking goal for the day but he didn't bother me at all the octogenarian sweethearts behind me were enjoying their soup coffee and cigarettes perhaps this is their afternoon ritual i bet it is i rather enjoyed their camaraderie in the barback mirror where was i right my sandwich was great - almost too much to eat my bartender took an interest in my lunch selection and she asked if i liked hot mustard not as in would you like mustard or mayonnaise but more like pssst do you like hot mustard like she already knows i do then offers me some of her own secret stash to put on my sandwich the potato salad was spot on the french onion soup was hot tasty and cheesy i left her a 25 tip and headed back to the airport so the next time i'm flying through philly and have a bit of time you bet i'm swinging by lehman's it sure beats the overpriced dreck at chickie peet's in the terminal 
not worth the hype the brisket doesn't actually have much flavor would be nice if there were a sauce bar where you could pick your own sauces and refill as you please 
flying through philly my next flight offers dinner but i was hungry and hey i'm in philly so can't go wrong with geno's right i do love a good cheesesteak now i'm looking forward to dinner on my flight quantity of meat was quite good-- no flavor and overcooked though you basically have to drown it in condiments order taker suggested the provolone i couldn't taste it bread was hard no way that was made in house anytime recently tip if you want a better philly cheesesteak go two doors down to subway and order a tuna melt 
cute place inside the library not far off interstate caramel macchiato was great girls were sweet 
ive been on hold forever and online forever struggling to pay my bill this is not my first time using a computer their website absolutely sucks and so does the phone service i will be paying this motorcycle off asap so i don't give them a penny more then absolutely necessary i should have paid a higher interest rate at a better company what a dump 
stopped in about a week ago most of our group ordered the four course special and of course we had the bloomin onion what's going on with the size of the bloomin onion it was incredibly small and cooked too well and then our four course dinner came all at once 4 courses means 1 courses at a time 
i went in this place and purchased some stepping stones for my garden left there and went to lowes and found them at a cheaper price most everything in there seemed over priced and of very poor quality don't waste your time go to lowes or home depot and you will get good service and a better quality 
the food was amazing we had mac and cheese shrimp and grits and a yummy appetizer great atmosphere and great service 
daniel the budtender is dope great service a boat load of daily deals i will definitely be returning often

as an active real estate investor i've had business dealings with realtors all over the united states and i can say without reservation that joe carroll is the most dedicated trustworthy cordial and knowledgeable professional that i have encountered in decades i needed to obtain some information on a property in the east st louis area that was acquired on my behalf at a tax lien auction as a resident of california i was not familiar with the area nor did i know whether the property was occupied or whether it was marketable after attempting to contact several agents in the surrounding area joe was the first and only realtor who promptly returned my call within hours of our initial discussion joe surveyed the property sent me photos of the interior and exterior contacted me regarding the status of the property and conducted a market analysis that provided me with a comparable market value additionally when i requested his expertise in documenting a fair market evaluation of this property again he far exceeded expectations with a comprehensive report supported by photos comparative neighboring property values etc --- again in record time his service and support are truly remarkable and it didn't cost me a penny so whether you are a seller buyer investor or just need information about a property i highly recomment contact joe you'll be extremely pleased by the outstanding service you receive james c
i'm not a coffee person but this chai tea latte was the bee's knees the cranberry danish was buttery flaky deliciousness i see why there's often a line at this place
this store really has some good deals on home decor you may never think of to add some flair to a room 
two of my nails chipped the first day and second day i got it i got gel shellac and asked the lady to make sure she covers the edges but she just did a shoddy job now i have to go back and see if they will fix everything waste of time 
some of the best fish in stl mac cheese sweet potatoes were delicious hubby also had old bay seasoning chicken which was great you can't go wrong if you are looking for some good soul food like grandma used to make
walked right in and joined my friend in the bar as she was already seated at a table i ordered a blood orange rita wings and a cheese pizza my drink tasted odd and we could not find anyone to let them know for a few minutes after a while it seemed like our server was working the whole restaurant by himself another worker appeared but she was doing more socializing than anything else my wings came out a bit cold not sure if they sat in the window too long or if it was the sauce not being heated when i told our server he made me a fresh drink and brought me fresh wings my wings were so bomb omg he was apologetic and nice i still can't figure out why his coworkers weren't helping him i totally regret not ordering a thin crust pizza as the hand tossed is just a bit too doughy for my liking my 2nd drink was fine my friends food was good as well we will be back again they serve pizza flatbread pasta it's all pretty good 
wow where to begin after taking a full 30 minutes to place my order thru the mobile app which i acknowledge is not the responsibility of the franchise owner but it was frustrating none the less and being charged twice i showed up they had no record of my order despite showing them my order confirmation and the charges to my bank account i was treated rudely and condescendingly by the lady working there her name tag said anna then a man walked guess he was the owner manager out to clarify my concerns he more or less reiterated what i was told before albeit in a slightly more polite manner he said he had no record of our order and that i would have take it up with subway directly which i most certainly intend to do to top it off a man walked in while i was there to report some vagrant lighting something by the side of the building the owner just shrugged it off and said the guy was homeless and he was always there in closing despite the fact that i was charged twice i left with no food and no refund stay far far away 
mussels duck breast with fennel risotto fresh made doughnuts with espresso creme anglaise delicious this place is very delicious the type of food that's focused well prepared and the prices are totally reasonable great service oh i'll be back
we got a lot of really good italian food there the family-style dining is a lot of fun but it makes it easy to run up a large bill if you're not paying attention and we weren't but we had great leftovers for days to come 
good sushi that's priced ok this is not the best sushi i have ever had but it is a solid good place to go i will definitely return the staff was very nice and attentive and it was quick and child friendly 
really enjoyed our visit despite waiting an hour for our table 745 reservations seated at 845 apps-pig ears and wings wings were the bomb smoky and spicy ears were good but covered in sweet bbq-like sauce and hard to eat as they were served as a lettuce wrap the warm wet napkins that were brought to wipe our hands was an awesome and needed surprise i had the pork chop with potato puree and cabbage all was excellent my gf had the chicken which was good but the dumplings in broth was too salty to eat we skipped dessert our waitress elise was awesome good with recommendations and speedy service 
this aquarium is amazing they had so many different animals like a sloth sharks turtles iguanas bearded dragons crabs and so many more they are very nice and let you hold whatever you want i got to hold a snake and a blue tongue skink they also let you feed animals for example the sharks turtles alligator sloth and fish the staff knows a lot about these animals so you can learn a lot about the different things you get to see another great thing about this place is that they aren't expensive at all the prices are very fair and the experience is amazing and memorable 
common indianapolis get out try flavors other than meet and potatoes philippine is a friendly country merging flavors free m america hawaii and the philippine makes rook a star restaurant come with friends ask them to bring you one dish at a time and retreat into a food orgy 
accidentally found this restaurant the rolled tacos with green sauce were on point nice quick and fresh lunch chips and salsa were great and the service awesome clean and the tacos only 5 or 6 for the plate 
with the casual dress and a laid back atmosphere i was pleasantly surprised with how excellent the service was it was some of the best service i've ever had waiter was outstanding and the front of the house manager checked with us immediately after we received our food based on other yelp recommendations we got the bbq oysters and the alligator boudin balls both were phenomenal and i don't use that term lightly i make my own boudin so you could call me a boudin snob this boudin was sooooo good the alligator was extremely tender and wasn't overpowered with spice as you frequently find with alligator even the arugula salad with a creole mustard vinaigrette they served with it was surprisingly good as for the bbq oysters this was one of the best appetizers i've ever had the mix of hot sauce butter and honey that they toss the perfectly fried oysters in is absolutely delectable for our entrees my wife got the filet and i got the crab cakes both were awesome the filet was cooked perfect and is served with horseradish garlic mashed potatoes i will cook my mashed potatoes with prepared horseradish from here on out i loved the tang it added especially with the accompaniment of the garlic the crab cakes were good lots of meat very little filler lightly fried they definitely make the crab flavor the star of the show we frequent new orleans a couple times a year and my wife already said this was her favorite meal there ever i thoroughly enjoyed it myself we will be back btw we made reservations for 6pm on a sunday but didn't need it there was a line out the door at acme oyster if those poor souls in line only knew this gem was a hundred feet from where they were standing 
big friendly portions a great price omelets r good the benedicts also - a bkfst spot
the shrimp rundown are unbelievably delicious the damn good nachos are great for sharing the margaritas the berry best i'm biased about this place the customer service is second to none enjoy yourself 
unique concept with a great open feel to it love there are multiple options for food and several local beers on tap
i was craving mexican food after class and this joint was only a mile way i got the 3 mini taco plate which were pretty normal size tacos and my cousin got the quesadilla they surely didn't disappoint this will definitely be my go-to mexican spot around campus and they have a drive-thru as well which was pretty cool 
awesome i always get the goat curry plantains and red beans and rice they also have great little patties with meat or veggies the location is perfect because my friends and i can sit on the patio with beer from union brewery wonderful place with nice workers too 
easy sit down mediterranean cafe sandwhich and salads along with a soup dujour are your options i was very delighted with the kindness of the staff and the overall warm and inviting atmosphere the chicken sandwhich i ordered was ready in 2 minutes and was so good the roll was fresh baked like right out of the oven feel i recommend this relaxing little cafe for a place to come and get work done on your laptop while you enjoy some simple yet delicious food 
the flavors are so weird it's called little baby's for a reason and it's been in fishtown for like 10 years for a reason the visit is an experience in itself 
a few days ago i ordered chicken garlic sauce from here i noticed new faces recently so i'm guessing new owners regardless food was terrible the chicken tasted like it had been sitting in an open cardboard box in the freezer and the garlic sauce barely present because the food was so bad i didn't bother to return it for more bad food the broccoli and veggies tasted fine and the rice was cooked properly so i gave it one star as the two main ingredients were not what they should be at least the cooks wore hats this time in the past this wasn't always the case 
i posted a review a couple of months ago telling the bad experience i had with the body shop out of fairness i removed the post until i got a resolution here is the outcome in the first week of july i took my camper in to have a small hole repaired in the back with an estimated 2 week turn around they missed 4 completion dates and finally called me almost 2 months later that it was ready i go to pick it up and it had more damage than when i took it in including damage on the inside no managers were on duty when i tried to pick it up so i left it there it took several calls over the next week to get the manager to respond he finally called and agreed the damage was their fault and said he would take care of it i went to pick it up and the damage was repaired as agreed however it was still nasty i left the camper there clean inside and out there was shop towels and grime all over the toilet and shower you would think after causing the issue in the first place he would have seen it was at least cleaned up however the shower was still dirty they removed the towels and and that was about all we were there for almost 2 hours picking it up the people were in slow motion the ticket wasn't closed out and the guy that had to close it had already gone home again after the issues they caused you would think they might put in a little effort to take care of us and make us feel like valued customers instead of low life trash given the situation it would seem a little quicker response would be warranted however we were left standing and waiting they did repair the damage they caused but not one thing more not even a simple wash the customer service is awful while we were there a couple more customers were complaining about the service as well the common thread was if you own a travel trailer i purchased from them by the way they treat you with no respect while the man that had the 1 2 million coach was given the royal treatment when he came in including ignoring me standing there trying to get answers and taking care of him i treat all people equal and i expect the same lazydays has lost my business and any referrals i was giving to them 
since moving to philadelphia from san francisco a couple years ago i have been on the hunt for a high-intensity low impact workout that 1 provides me an escape from the rest of my day and 2 one with which i can really see and feel the changes sfs is it we all have stephanie the upbeat and encouraging studio owner to thank for bringing megaformer to the neighborhood if you want noticeably increased strength a stronger core and visible results in just weeks this is class is for you all of the instructors teach at a different caliber than any in the city -- they lead class with confidence grace knowledge and creativity getting the hang of the machine and the slow purposeful movements will take a while especially if you're used to the chaotic large moves many other fitness studios encourage don't be afraid of your body shaking especially your limbs -- that's just your slow muscle fibers twitching and with them you'll feel that workout even after you leave the studio thank you stephanie and team you all are truly a gem amongst the city's fitness options 
ohhh my gosh i work for an airline and and just here for the day a co-worker told me this food was incredible and she was right on i got the bulgogi bowl it was insane so delicious i can't wait to come back next month it's a big big portion so i might have em split it into two bowls next time so i can have leftovers tomorrow highly recommend a million stars 
i contacted 3 rug cleaners and this is the only one that returned my email request they were able to schedule an appointment within 3 days of contact too so that was amazing extremely professional rug cleaning-- our wool rug looks so much better than it did before unfortunately there are still pet smells remaining so we'll probably have to spend three times what we just paid to get it submerged and fumigated before we're through thanks t t for doing the initial cleaning 
this is one of the most disastrous places to eat indian food ordered a chicken biriyani and there came a bowl of rice mixed in watery chicken curry it absolutely makes no sense to the cook who created this piece of disaster this can be seen in the attached pic note to the management and the cook please don't run an indian restaurant create disasters with indian food if you can't cook authentic recipes 
my friend told me about this place and i will never forgive him because i will now crave it forever usually not a big fan of american chains but my gawd this place is good the spicy chicken isn't spicy as much as flavourful and the coating is the crunchiest i have ever experienced the chicken itself is dripping-not with grease but juice perfect and they have really unique sides i got red beans and rice and was in heaven-very reminiscent of what i had in new orleans they then top it all off with a buttery biscuit-does it get any better no it does not i have to make a sincere effort not to eat here every day 
one of the worst cvs locations in the city in terms of employees --there are a couple i've witnessed who stand out and give the rest of the nice people --a very bad name i blame the management i just witnessed a situation escalate rapidly over the course of about 10 minutes --nearly come to blows --when an employee engaged with a customer i'm not going to say the woman wasn't angry --but listening on--i completely got it--and saw how the employee continually escalated an already angry person --unnecessarily as another customer in the store i could really care less --about the reason behind this he was saying some very inappropriate things --to someone who was obviously--upset he just kept engaging with her--long after he should have called a manager instead he let it escalate into a bad situation --which could have been alleviated --had he not continued to antagonize the woman --over extra bucks really the management needs to get it together --she finally came out but as i left the store i notice that she hasn't handled the situation at all --and is still allowing the employee --to stand there instead of asking him to step aside and cool off --as someone who has management skills--should the employee was literally up in the customers face at one point egging her on it didn't help that the woman was a black woman --and the employee was white i felt this would not have gotten to this point --if she were white --or even a man just saying --you need to take care of this store corporate the sad part is in the past 15 years or so--i have had several employees --speak to me inappropriately-as well there just seems to be a general bad vibe --and a feel of antagonism --by the employees in this store--a disrespect --and a feeling they can speak any way they feel like --to customers --with no repercussions and no management around to witness their bad behavior or correct it it's a shame because there are many great cvs locations and nice employees in many of your other stores i had to take the time write this because the employees at this location --need a serious attitude adjustment quick fast and in a hurry this particular young man--needs to be fired in my opinion 
the best mexican food everything is good it gets hard choosing what to order great salsa bar chips are awesome great food just the best mexican food in town 
bagel factory definitely presents a worthy option for a morning feeding whether you are overhung or just hungry bagel factory always hit the spot not the biggest fan of the coffee but their sausage egg and cheese on a plain bagel toasted is a staple i will revisit a bagel factory location next time i am near hungry and it is early
i have been using this cleaners for years i have never had a problem with their services they are generally friendly and have always had my clothes ready as promised their prices are also comparable to other cleaners i heard they may be closing down due to a tdot project to widen nolensville rd i'm not sure when that will take place or if it's even true hopefully not because they are a good neighborhood cleaners for the lenox village area 
i brought my nursing students to brunch we asked to sit together and was placed in the beautiful private dining room facing the foods everything was delicious crab soup bar bbq beef home made pizza salads grilled vegetable and dessert bar tiffany was our sever and even with a group of 10 no needs were unmet all this was under 20 including drinks no where is this possible in nola hyatt 8 block is the best 
wow what a great thai restaurant had the satay chicken tres bien spring rolls good red curry with shrimp good thom kum soup tres bien lamb chops great service is amazing definitely hit this place ask for tippy 
you listen and you listen good- this place this place the neighborbood is daunting ristoranti on every corner how to choose choose this firstly i'm an italian from philly so i'm picky on italian food nonna knows best is the phrase i believe gian-tony's was recommended to me by the local cigar shop owner we brought the owner a cigar his daughter laughed and knew where i came from immediately we were sat ate the toasted ravioli drank pirroni beer and feasted on clam sauce juicy delicious chicken and delectable meat sauce i loved every bite i'm flying my family out to st louis and eating here if you live within 100miles and you aren't here now you get in the damn car and go 
i wasn't impressed with their lunch selection they need to re-write the menu it's very poorly structured and confusing for a first time customer the service was slow the rolls were very loose and kept falling apart i won't be returning 
the first korean restaurant i have been to which was a few years ago looks shady from the outside since it is basically a house however there food is delicious and reasonly priced for lunch their lunch boxes give you a crap load of food for 10 chicken bulgogi is my favorite lunch box there my appetizer of choose has to be there kim chi dumplings there chicken wings are extremely good but are expensive because they give so much so it's good if you are in like a party of 4 or if that is your only meal 
i'm indian and am very picky about indian food in general this place has hands down the best service i've experienced at any indian restaurant even the super expensive ones the food was really delicious we had the chicken karahi and cheese dosa both were amazing in terms of flavor quantity and quality of food the garlic naan was probably the best i've had in a very long time most naan is really good but this was exceptional with much more fresh garlic than i've seen at other indian restaurants the sambhar that comes with the dosa was so perfectly flavorful but really spicy i can't handle any spice really so they went out of their way to make adjustments to the sambhar and gave me a side of yogurt no charge to accommodate me they also gave us a free appetizer of chicken pakora because they understand that they're south indian dishes dosa take a little longer than normal to prepare we had our food in a reasonable amount of time too so it's not like we complained and then they gave us something they gave us the pakora past immediately after we ordered i would say that's pretty amazing customer service they anticipated our potential needs i would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys indian food or wants to try it for the first time 
i'm keeping on and working my way through the menu had the tower sandwich and it was great my husband had the ham-a-tampa and i tried a bite of that and it was extraordinary haven't been disappointed yet 
i can't say i am a duck connoisseur since my experience is very limited this to me seemed like a solid duck choice if visiting reading terminal market i ended up getting the soup with duck and it was a delicious mix of a somewhat clear broth perfectly cooked noodles that were really good and equally delicious duck the duck is well seasoned and i can taste the star anise and other spices used to season the duck the staff was courteous to my indecisiveness 
still great food and service i am actually not so happy with paying 6 99 for one beer a small 16oz one 6 99 what 
bbq in st louis should be divided into bps before pappy's smokehouse and aps after pappy's smokehouse before pappy's bbq in st louis was mediocre at best there wasn't a place tourists were drawn to despite st louis' reputation for st louis-style ribs then pappy's arrived it was heaven 90 minute lines became routine fast forward to now there are new bbq places popping up all over the area almost monthly with distinct flavors and meats pappy's is still right up there with the best of them and i'll take their smoked meats and sweet potato fries any day however i've had a couple inconsistent experiences here that knock it down to four stars i also don't think it compares at all to the best of the best in kansas city for st louis i prefer bogart's for the sauces pastrami baked beans and shorter line 
cannot say enough good things about this restaurant their japanese chinese and thai are all excellent the owner is so friendly and accommodating their bento boxes come with a lot of food and their soups are very good i've never had a bad experience here the service is good very friendly and eager to help if they can definitely visit 
great place just stopped by to look one day while i was stuck in traffic and i am glad i did elizabeth worked with me taking her time showing me different rings to surprise my wife for our anniversary went back a week later and made the decision and the surprise for my wife was perfect a huge thanks to the entire staff for all of their help and how friendly and helpful they are this is our new jeweler without question highly recommend coming here to get the right jewelry 
after lots of trips to new orleans finally decided to try galatoires what a mistake first of all we were 3 sisters all in their 70's we aren't young and beautiful or a power business group the service or lack there of was terrible think the oldest server was assigned to our table all he was interested in was the table of businessmen sitting next to us after sitting for 10 minutes he finally brought us menus then when we were finished we had to ask someone to clear the dishes off the table the oysters were delicious the rest of the meals were just ok somewhat dry braised short ribs and a little too much cheese sauce with not much crab in the crab au gratin 130 for the 3 of us definitely not worth it we travel a great deal and have had better food and service in restaurants where the cost was less or comparable 
love this place while it's not a place i can frequent due to my location it's got its reputation as a famous bakery in reading terminal market for a reason the donuts are baked on site and have a homemade taste and quality about them while still tasting like a gourmet donut whenever i have time i usually stop by and pick up a dozen and there's never any that go to waste if you go at the end of the day you can usually get a good deal on more depending on what's left never had a bad experience at this place 
on wednesday september 5th my husband and i hosted a rehearsal dinner for 60 guests at spasso's i can't say enough good things about it first i booked the room in january 2018 from our first meeting sam was as accommodating as could be we checked in again in july and brought the bride groom with us for dinner we were able to see the room again ask questions everyone was great and the food was delicious we came again a week before the dinner with our final count questions about music speakers etc and again we left feeling very confident things were well in hand the dinner itself was a big hit we were very excited and it seemed that sam and the staff were excited right along with us the room looked great we had everything we needed the staff was super and made a fuss over the centerpieces i made which i greatly appreciated the service was spot on and i'm very fussy the food was terrific and i still heard compliments about it at the wedding three days later it was a wonderful night and spasso's was the perfect place in every way 
great food and great service i would highly recommend this restaurant for date night family dinner night or a special meal with friends 
very good will be back little expensive but worth it people treat u very nice very clean
we love ethnic foods and we're somewhat picky but saffron is indian done right now i admit that i've not been to the sub-continent but i've had what was described as authentic indian in singapore--yet saffron brings their a game to the table and they are well worth a visit 
good price poor web interface they advertise special savings but when i tried to reserve online it would not take a card with an expiration date 5 years in future they then refused any advertised discount parking bus is is slower to pick up than others in area as others would have 3-4 buses passing before their slow one would come around waited more than 1 2 hour for pickup 
horrible service i think this company intentionally hires from the bottom of the barrel its absolutely no way every employee in every store can be this incompetent and ive visited locations in 6 cities and each time the employees leave you frustrated by some blunder 
elena is incredible getting a brazilian isn't always the most comfortable but every time i see elena she explains everything perfectly makes it pretty much painless and always makes me laugh so i don't feel awkward i love her when going to bella brazilian only ask for elena 
hot and ready looked like a thin crust with how uneven it has been made and about 5 days old skip this one go to east bay location which also had drive through 
rack job it's not cheap so why are there unqualified stylists cutting hair there my son got a tapered cut tapered buzzed longer crown the back of his neck was buzzed and you could see from 1 2 a block away that one end was higher than another i showed farah that she not only was it off but it wasn't as thinned out sure she said re-cut my son comes back i don't know how she did it but now the slant is even more pronounced either farah doesn't believe me or pissed that for some reason i'm not happy with the redo the receptionist gives me a ruler i discreetly show farah she says she sees it i'm trying not to call her out or throw any hysteria bc the girl's got her reputation pride too so the 2nd redo is now a hack job the good side is almost sheared right off now the slant is still there and the opposite side is still lower thick at this point i'm done the receptionist said that she too can see the slant the fixes looked bad we walked down to grab my son some food as i'm looking at him directly across the table i see that his sideburns are 2 different lengths sheesh can this haircut get any worse i don't know about you but i will drive to pay good money for quality product or service my trendy teenager son says he doesn't want to meet his friends this afternoon until his hair is fixed i can't cut hair or own a clipper now i'm going to spend elsewhere if i can get in 
great ambiance great burger and live music it's the perfect place to wind down after a busy week 
well tomorrow it will be a week since they came out on a washer repair and said a part had to be ordered - just little bands that hold the drum in place i have called them everyday this week and left a message they never answer their phone to inquire about where the part is and they simply will not return my call to give me an update today i resorted to calling american home shield so they can intervene and help me out and now they say the part is on order i could have ordered the part on amazon and had it at the house the next day but for some reason they can't seem to pinpoint when it will arrive and the worst part is they can't call me to give me an update zero respect for companies who don't return customers phone calls 
five stars is for the food service i thought could use some extra coaching felt like our waitress was rushed and yes it was busy but she wouldn't even wait a second it was like she was on a mission my wife and i ordered the bazuka guacamole which was awesome albeit expensive - 17 my wife ordered the sea bass tacos and i ordered the mahi mahi tacos the sea bass tacos had corn tortillas so i wasn't a big fan the mahi mahi tacos were excellent this restaurant is rated on yelp as having two dollar signs which is really not the case my wife and i ordered only three things and we dropped 60 so either the restaurant needs to increase their quantity to justify the price tag or increase their dollar signs on yelp
when in town delivery is always placed from pasta mista the baked ziti is literally the best i've ever had opposed to home made prices are reasonable delivery is quick and food is almost always on point

went to see white house down i love this theater because it is close to my house and i usually enjoy the cinebistro with girlfriends for our ladies night out my husband and i decided to forego the cinebistro and just sat in general admission seating 
was contacted by the owner of the salon who offered for me to come in and get my hair fixed complimentary i've learned to live with my hair until it grows out a bit before i play with it again but i definitely appreciate the gesture 
an instant favorite went on opening day and already looking forward to going back 4rivers has the perfect formula that cafeteria style is awesome for bbq there's nothing else like it in tampa bay reminiscent to chipotle i wanted to try the entire menu it all looked and smelled so good i went all out and ordered a little bit of everything tried numerous sides corn sweet potato casserole bread pudding baked beans collard greens and i must say it was all very delicious the bread pudding was phenomenal didn't expect it to be that good trust me it's worth going to 4rs for this one side alone then we go on to the brisket and the prime rib in one word heaven the location is excellent good parking comfortable seating you can dine in or order take-out they also sell cupcakes which is a nice touch they also have to go boxes and lids right by the soda fountain so instead of waving someone down you can grab it yourself when you're ready how fantastic i'm not one to drop the big 5 on just any business but 4rs is well deserved 
super friendly place drinks are not spendy at all a gin tonic and a mac jack for only 6 and they have golden tee great place to prefunk or just chill play the card games rukus is fun 
absolutely one of my favorite places to eat here in new orleans the staff are absolutely fantastic if get to go say hi to brandon he is a sweetheart the service is always great they recognize your face and when they get your takeout together they leave you awesome notes see pic every single thing i have personally had to eat there has been phenomenal i highly recommend their hummus as well 
update 6-6-14 well car-x said there was nothing wrong with my front-end suspension or brakes but the car continued to feel dramatically wrong --- even dangerous --- so i took it to another service provider christian brothers in fishers they immediately found that the rotors were warped and in need of machining and that the cv joints were bone dry due to ripped cv joint boots they resurfaced the rotors all around and replaced the half shafts cv boots the car now feels as it should and stops appropriately i am revising my rating down to two stars which i give for the car-x staff's friendliness and willingness to invest time in talking to me and assessing the vehicle albeit incorrectly i'm surprised by reading some of the bad reviews here i took a lexus lx470 to this car-x and received excellent golden rule treatment by doug the manager and anthony the tech who assessed my vehicle they didn't experience what i sense the car's brakes are doing and instead of putting a bunch of parts on that the vehicle may not need they told me they didn't think the car needs anything at this time and to just keep an eye on the situation i appreciated the time they put into the car test driving it more than once and fully examining the brakes all around and the high degree of integrity they showed by not selling me goods services they didn't think i needed i offered to pay for the assessment but the declined to take a payment i think this type of treatment is all-too-uncommon in today's marketplace i will not hesitate to take another vehicle to them should the need arise 
life is strange when it gets even stranger you head down to tucson then in a momentary lapse of judgement and out of just pure bad taste you decide to go to la parilla suiza for shrimp tacos when your sense returns after a half decent margarita you realise you should have made the 20 min drive to la botana the shrimp tacos at la parilla could make you desperately desire taco bell if you are in tucson and are looking for a mouth watering good deal memorable food and not la parilla suiza try the shrimp tacos here just do it 
3 stars is based entirely on the food i ordered the spicy shrimp curry and it was really tasty not so much on the spicy it had a little kick but if you advertise spicy i feel like i should be leaving with my sinuses cleared the onions were a little underdone not raw but definitely crunchy the flavour was spot on and a lunch entree was quite filling i actually had half left over now for the huge downside to eating here-the service cheese and rice these people are pretty darn rude it's as if you are bothering them by wanting to dine in their establishment they reach across you to refill your water when it doesn't need it they auction off your order instead of remembering who ordered what and good luck trying to get something once your food hits the table you pretty much don't exist to them at that point not that you ever did until you pay the check that is they didn't bring the check to us we had to walk up to the register to pay oh that is one bright side we had a party of 9 and there was no issue what-so-ever with splitting checks we each told them what we ordered paid for that and bounced moral of the story- the good food out weighed the bad service-for me anyway 
not that great and we spilled a water no biggie but the staff wasn't that busy and 3 of their employees watched as i cleaned it up with napkins instead of going to get a mop not the greatest customer service when i worked in restaurants we would have offered to help clean it up since it was near 50 for 4 people you'd expect a little more
i just recently moved in so do not have a lot of feedback but would like to address some prior reviews here 1 there are no bugs or rats in my apartment 2 the management tells you when maintenance will come it was 24-48 hours for me 3 not only has maintenance came to help me twice but leaves note of what they did after fixing any major or miniscule issues - thank you 4 rosemary and co are very professional - nobody expects your leasing agent to be your best friend but if i have any questions issues or concerns she the other agents are there for me 5 also the rooms don't look like the pictures duh your furniture is supposed to be in them overall tldr they were built in the 1980's and renovated fairly recently so as long as you expect a fair-priced quality apartment in a phenomenal location and solid staff check it out hope this helps 
this is the worst food i have ever had and i know arabic food how delicious it is but in this place they make food without it having any taste i asked for falafel and the worst sandwich seemed to be old and the sandwich shape was not arranged and i asked for the kofta i don't know how to describe the smell of meat and taste but it is definitely not kofta that i used to eat
all outdoor seating in a beautiful alley with lovely twinkling lights and candles ambience is wonderful here we ordered the hongo and the mushroom escargot both were delicious the service was not super fast but if you are not in a rush you can just enjoy the ambience while you wait would recommend for sure for any vegetarians or vegans out there the location is great too if you are in the french quarter definitely check it out 
yesterday i went there to have batteries put in car remote starters unfortunately they did not have them but they said they would the next day today they replaced the batteries but only charged me for 1 since they were out yesterday that is excellent customer service both young ladies were friendly and knowledgeable i highly recommend this business 
fantastic food i've had multiple gyros and thought they were all phenomenal friends love coming here from out of town the location in o'fallon is simply better it's a shame the location in soulard has such awful hours only complaint would be 5 starts if it wasn't for the fact their hours are just awful 
background i've only ever gotten my eyebrows threaded once and i liked the results but they also slightly shaped them i have also had my eyebrows waxed one time and was left with thin brows that did not look natural as a first time client i can say that this place is amaze i don't like to get my eyebrows shaped or anything like that so i ask for a clean up i think this method is more detailed than waxing so you don't walk out of there with some unnatural looking brows with red halos but rather the threading consolidates your hair and makes them look fuller by taking out extra hair that aren't doing much and you can cont about your day without any makeup as always i fill in my brows and they look super clean fuller and really accentuate your eyes my lady gave me like a little massage and was super quick--a definite plus they also have a stamp card which is nice since i use my mom's appt and can work my way to a free threading a little quicker 
the service is great they are very responsive and reliable i always can schedule visits when i need them they also send emails with updates and pictures after every visit i appreciate the help 
i just received the best cut and color service from kallie ann at pure concepts i was so nervous going to a new stylist especially after some particularly bad experiences but i walked out loving my hair from the moment you walk in to the last snip of the scissors you'll feel pampered relaxed and confident in your new 'do kallie ann was so personable she listened to what i wanted she gave me great recommendations on what my hair needed and she did exactly what she said she would no surprises the cut and color comes with a relaxing hand arm massage during your wash out a scalp massage and a calming peppermint oil neck massage are you calling to schedule your appointment yet 
a recent transplant i'm so relieved to find philly-quality food in delco super delicious 
i came to bodega bar for the official opening and it was everything i was expecting eclectic modern design with latin n pop culture flair the drinks are amazing and worth every penny i had the ginger rodr guez which was sweet and smoky and the queen of the night which was soft and sweet i tried the brussel sprouts and those were great i will definitely be returning to try more of the food dishes the have a dj that starts around 9p but i left before then
loved ivana she is passionate kind and knowledgeable you'll leave her wanting to come back she makes you feel so welcomed and will do anything to make you feel comfortable i've been waxed in many different states finding a new wax person always comes with a boatload of anxiety waxing is so personal i was lucky enough to find ivana pretty early on i'm so thankful i've had a chance to see a couple of her other services too i can't wait to try a facial bonus is she uses all organic and american made products this week will be my 3rd time seeing her and i can't wait 
first things first know you're going to spend a pretty penny at this place esp if your compare the prices to saraga or aldi which are both nearby that being said know that the quality ingredients sources generally warrant the price tag at georgetown market i have been here a handful of times usually when i'm in the area they have a great selection that tickles my health-conscious self so i stop in every now and then to find something very specific that a recipe calls for most recently i stopped in on a whim as i was waiting for a friend in the area i decided to check out their turmeric ginger juice that was pre-bottled honestly this was by far the best juice i've ever had in my life i made sure to drink every last drop in that bottle as it was that delicious i crave that juice nearly everyday and can't wait to get back there soon to purchase a few great place to shop at if you have the extra income or if you're looking for very specific health conscious items don't forget to sign up for their rewards 
50 floor replaced the hardwood flooring that squeaked and the quarter round that was poorly installed the jobs are now complete and we are satisfied 
hands down the best food i have found in the area it is even picky toddler approved he ate the pork coleslaw mac and cheese and the cornbread 
look i know that part of this is my fault as i bought a 240 000 used rv from these people with just their word that is was a 9 out of 10 in condition i had the rv delivered at my cost 1600 miles away before the purchase i had the salesman walk the rv with his phone on the line with me and asked specific questions regarding the condition of this rv he said it was in excellent condition and not a scratch in it the interior was in excellent condition i also spoke with the sales manager regarding the condition and said i didn't want to deal with an issue he assured me i would love it well the coach shows up and its a mess maybe a 6 out of 10 cracked tile on the floor in the interior not one maybe 6 or so peeling wall paper in the bedroom slide very noticeable even looks like soft wood wall behind it dash board is peeling away from the base the interior was filthy dirty my wife was grossed out the bed assist strut is broken off the wood in the bed box cabinets had cracked wood at the controls for lights switches and the ornamental ceiling was warped and hanging down on one end wait there is more that was just on the inside there was stress cracks in front of the steps to get in it the trim around the steps looked like they had been kicked many times dented there was body damage and cracks around the rear battery compartment and the kicker is that the roof was separating from the sidewall of the coach the coach had overspray from a paint repair of some sort all over it i called the salesman and the sales manager the next day it was delivered in the dark and told him this was not the coach for me i wanted to unwind the deal and have them keep my trade on consignment i offered to return the coach back to the at my cost they said no but they would fix the issues folks there is no way this coach could be fixed to my satisfaction it was a mess the pictures taken of the inside deliberately omitted the defects i just wanted out of this there is a better end to this story no thanks to the arizona store i again spoke with the manager and offered to purchase a new coach if they would just give me what i paid for it towards a new coach they immediately turned me to the florida store where i had purchased a coach previously and was very happy with there service and the used coach i purchased a 2009 monaco dynasty the florida store contacted me and began negotiations like i had owned this coach for years it was to be handled as a trade in not an unwind in the end i purchased a 2014 tiffin allegro bus nice coach and it got to my house beautifully i lost money on the coach i traded in and had to pay msrp for the coach i purchased a lot of this is my fault as i have a thing about trust now i got to say the boys in florida are awesome and did everything they said they would and described both coaches i purchased from them perfectly but the deal in the end was horrible i lost equity big time oops buyer beware of the boys in arizona and maybe its a corperate culture but i will say this could have been a glowing review with just a few tweeks in the customer treatment and complaint resolution process in the end we think we will be happy with our new tiffin allegro bus but the lazy days emblem on the coach will raise some interesting conversation in the campgrounds i visit 
dirtiest hotel e er the carpet is hard and crunchy no one has cleaned in a long time no updating in a long time location is great next to i hop a gas station and a small mall if you don't mind slumming this isn't the place 
i haven't bieen able to go shopping for over 2 months now because of this covid 19 and i heard that there was another f21 at the summit mall and it just opened after being closed because of co-vid so i thought i would head out there well do not go all the way out there if you are a plus sized gal cuz the f21 out there has no plus sized clothes omg what a joke what a waste of gas and time store is closing anyways also the f21 in meadowood mall did the same thing oh well you lost a lot of business from me this way this sucks 
very surprised how nice the garden was went not expecting too much but turned out to be beautiful so many different types of flowers and trees if we lived closer we would get season passes and have lunch there don't know if you can really do that but it sure would be nice to have a picnic there nice and relaxing walk 
been around for a long long time food is excellent and best beans in town i always rate mexican restaurants by their beans playa azul definitely the best
they built a shower enclosure for me as well as installed sliding closet doors in my room staff was professional and provided a smooth timely install a custom mirror was also made and staff measured everything twice to minimize error definitely would recommend 
i went in on sunday for an oil change however i was told they couldn't do it because my oil plug was rounded and they weren't able to get it out they told me they would get a tool to remove it and i should come back the next day however this didn't sit right with me why was my oil plug rounded i had taken my car here for the last few oil changes so only their staff had been handling the plug i made an appointment with my dealership and just picked up my car they told me that it looked like the sides of my oil plug had been sanded down it was so round and they needed to replace my oil pan because it was so stuck to be clear i am not saying this was intentionally done but regardless i had to spend almost 100 for a new oil pan in a 4 year old car i won't be returning because the convenience isn't worth the extra money to replace my oil pan again 
this bar is dangerous why it's the kind of neighborhood bar others should aspire to be unpretentious no frills no bs just really good beer and simple food the burger has such a backyard feel to it with its simplicity the patty is perfectly salted with a bit of pepper topped with cheese lettuce and tomato all wrapped up in a potato bun with a side of pickles no you are not asked how you want it cooked it's served medium as for their beer list it constantly rotates they do have 1 50 kenzinger during happy hour which is a great deal the atmosphere is so relaxed friendly and inviting that it's the kind of bar you can't help but fall for it's not the largest of spaces so it can get packed as the night progresses 
although i have never stayed here i've been here many times over the years for award dinners and fundraising events the dinners have been consistently delicious and well-plated the staff are very well-trained courteous and professional beautiful spaces reminiscent of the grandeur and elegance of the early 20th century 
we had breakfast there the bloody mary's were very good the breakfast was awesome more than you can eat and everything was really fresh and tasted great
best cupcakes in town gotta try the stawberry it has real berries in it worth the trip 
i love sang kee but this was my first time at the one at the reading terminal i wasn't too hungry just strolling and was a little greedy so i ordered the bourbon shish kabobs i must say that i was so disappointed so dry and crispy is it suppose to be like that i know it was only 2 bucks but damn any amount of money i spend i want the food to be delish it must have been left out all day or something well i do want to give this place another try because of all the great reviews next time i will try the roasted duck with green veggies and rice a real meal then i will see how they measure up
